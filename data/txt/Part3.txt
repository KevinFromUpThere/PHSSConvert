307 REGENT SQUARE

1. MID the splendours of the glory
Which we hope ere long to share,
Christ the Head, and we the members,
Shall appear divinely fair.
Oh how glorious,
When we meet Him in the air!

2. From the dateless, timeless periods
He has loved us without cause;
And for all the blood-bought myriads
His is love that knows no pause.
Matchless Lover!
Changeless as th' eternal laws.

3. Oh what gifts shall yet be granted,
Palms and crowns and robes of white, 
When the hope for which we panted
Bursts upon our gladdened sight,
And our Saviour
Makes us glorious through His might!

4. Bright the prospect soon to greet us
Of that longed-for nuptial day,
When from heaven He comes to meet us,
On His kingly, conquering way.
Then the Bridegroom
And the Bride shall reign for aye. 


308 AURELIA

1. LORD Jesus, we believing
In Thee have peace with God, Eternal life receiving,
The purchase of Thy blood. 
Our curse and condemnation
Thou barest in our stead; 
Secure is our salvation
In Thee, our risen Head.

2. The Paraclete revealing
Thy work has made us blest;
Thy stripes have given us healing,
Upon Thy love we rest.
 In Thee the Father sees us
Accepted and complete;
Thy blood from sin which frees us,
For glory makes us meet.

3. We know that nought can sever 
Our souls, O Lord, from Thee, 
And thus united ever
To all Thy saints are we.
We know Thy word declaring
The Father's wondrous love,
In which we all are sharing
With Thee, our Head above.

4. May we this love be showing
To all Thy members here, 
The channels for its flowing
Until Thou shalt appear, 
Until Thy Church in union,
Around the heavenly throne, 
Shall stand in blest communion
In Thee, Lord, joined in one.
 


309 PETITION
 
1. I KNOW no life divided,
O Lord of life, from Thee;
 In Thee is life provided
For all Thy saints and me.
I know no death, Lord Jesus,
Because I live in Thee;
Thy death it is which frees us 
From death eternally.

2. I fear no tribulation,
Since whatsoe'er it be,
It makes no separation
Between my Lord and me.
If Thou my God and Teacher 
Vouchsafe to be mine own,
Though poor I shall be richer 
Than monarch on his throne.

3. Thy love it was which sought me
(Thyself unsought by me),
And to the haven brought me
Where I would gladly be.
The things that once distressed me
 My heart no longer move,
Since This sweet truth impressed me, 
That I possess Thy love.


310 AGAPE TOU CHRISTOU

1. OURS are peace and joy divine
Who are one with Christ,
When, like branches in the vine,
We abide in Christ.
As a living, grafted shoot,
Nourished from a hidden root, 
We may bear all holy fruit
Through the love of Christ.
Love of Christ!
Clusters grow on every branch, 
Through the love of Christ.

2. Christian pity moves our heart
Through the love of Christ; 
Others' woes pierce like a dart,
When there's love to Christ. 
Gospel tidings we must tell, 
Sinners warn to flee from hell, 
Lure and win, alarm, compel,
By the love of Christ.
Love of Christ!
Heaven's ranks we'll seek to swell,
For the love of Christ.

3. We will love with tender care,
Knowing love to Christ, 
Brethren who His image bear,
For the love of Christ. 
Jesus only shall we know, 
And our love to all shall flow
In His blood-bought Church below,
For the love of Christ.
Love of Christ!
We now love all Christ-like ones,
For the love of Christ.

4. Now we live and walk by faith,
Through the love of Christ; 
We can triumph over death,
One in life with Christ. 
Rooted, settled, knowing more, 
Depths and heights of love explore, 
Till we gain the heavenly shore
Through the love of Christ.
Love of Christ!
When He comes we then shall know 
All the love of Christ.

Lord Jesus, all Thy members are!
A life divine to them is given, 
A long inheritance in heaven.

An heir of wrath and misery; 
Just as Thou art before the throne,
I stand in righteousness Thine own.

3. Just as Thou art, how wondrous free, 
Loosed by Thy sorrows on the tree! 
Lord, all the curse, the wrath were Thine, 
To give Thy saints this life divine.

Can with Thy spotlessness appear. 
Oh timeless love! as Thee I'm seen, 
"The righteouness of God in Him."

Life, light, and holiness are Thine. 
Thyself their endless source I see,

That woke me from my death of sin 
To know my perfectness in Him!

7. Oh teach me, Lord, this grace to own, 
That self and sin no more are known, 
That love, Thy love, in wondrous right, 
Hath placed me in its spotless light.

8. Soon, soon mid joys on joys untold, 
Thou wilt this grace and love unfold, 
Till worlds on worlds adoring see 
The part Thy members have in Thee.
 
Section 13. The Holy Spirit

312 MARTYRDOM

1. O LORD, we earnestly entreat
That in this solemn hour 
The blessed Holy Paraclete
May manifest His power.

2. May He, like mighty rushing wind 
Upon the waves beneath,
Move with one impulse every mind;
One soul, one feeling breathe.
The Holy Spirit

3. May He the young, the old inspire
With wisdom from above,
And give us hearts and tongues of fire,
To pray and praise and love.

4. Spirit of light! May He explore
And chase our gloom away,
With lustre shining more and more
Unto the perfect day.
 
5. May He, the blessed Paraclete,
Who with us doth abide
God's gracious purpose to complete, 
Be day by day our Guide. Amen
 


313 ABBEY

1. OH, what a comfort 'tis to know
We have, whate'er betide,
A mighty Helper here below, 
Who ever will abide.

2. The Holy Spirit in His grace,
With power that must prevail,
Has deigned to make His dwelling place 
These mortal bodies frail.

3. God's holy pledge sent down from heaven
To seal us for His own; 
The blessed earnest He has given
Of joys that shall be known.

4. Unerring Guide, He leads us in 
Truth's pathway by the word; 
And, if our spirits droop within, 
True comfort will afford.

5. When we the Father's presence seek
In child-like faltering prayer,
He helps our supplications weak 
By intercessions there.

6. May we His holy strivings know,
And to His voice give heed;
So by Him live and walk and grow, 
As sons of God indeed.


314 ST. CUTHBERT

1. OUR blest Redeemer, ere He breathed 
His tender, last farewell,
A Guide, a Comforter bequeathed,
With us to dwell.

2. He came in semblance of a dove,
With sheltering wings outspread, 
The holy balm of peace and love
On earth to shed.

3. He came in tongues of living flame
To teach, convince, subdue;
All powerful as the wind He came,
As viewless too.

4. He came sweet influence to impart,
A gracious, willing Guest,
Where He can find one humble heart
Wherein to rest.

5. And His that gentle voice we hear,
Soft as the breath of e'en, 
That chides each fault, that calms each fear
And speaks of heaven.

6. And every virtue we possess,
And every victory won,
And every thought of holiness,
Are His alone.

7. Spirit of purity and grace,
Our weakness pitying see;
Oh, make our hearts Thy dwelling place, 
And worthier Thee. Amen.
 


315 SAMSON

1. HAPPY am I! a gracious Friend
To dwell with me doth condescend; 
Though oft my foolish thoughts may roam, 
This Friend still makes my heart His home.

2. When I in Christ the Lord believed, 
And everlasting life received,
He sent His Spirit from above, 
That I might understand His love.

3. 'Twas He who made me know my sin, 
By nature Wicked and unclean;
'Twas He revealed the Son of God; 
And all the virtue of His blood.

4. 'Tis He who teaches me to pray 
To God my Father every day; 
To find my pleasure in the Lord, 
And in His holy written word.

5. When like a sheep I go astray
And turn to mine own foolish way, 
He brings me back in love and grace, 
Again to seek my Father's face.

6. He teaches me I'm very frail, 
But by His help I can prevail 
O'er Satan, sin, and every foe 
Whom I may meet while here below.

7. For Christ, my Master's quick return, 
'Tis He who teaches me to yearn;
The Paraclete, who, wondrous grace! 
Makes my poor heart His dwelling place.
 


316 OLNEY

1. GRANT that Thy Holy Spirit, Lord, 
May let His beams arise,
Dispel the darkness from our minds,
And open all our eyes.

2. Oh may He cheer our troubled hearts, 
That heavenly Paraclete;
Give us to lie, in humble faith,
At our Redeemer's feet.

3. May He revive our drooping faith,
Our doubts and fears remove;
And kindle in our breasts the flame
Of never-dying love.

4. May He convince us of our guilt,
And speak of Jesus' blood;
And to our wondering view reveal
The mighty love of God.

5. May He show us the Son of Man,
Who rules the courts of bliss,
The Lord of hosts, the Mighty God,
Th' eternal Prince of Peace.

6. For, Lord, 't is His to cleanse the heart, 
To sanctify the soul;
By opening up Thy precious word, 
To new-create the whole.

7. May He, who dwells in all our hearts, 
Our minds from sin set free,
That we may know and praise and love 
One God in Persons Three.
 


Section 14. The Christian's Life and Service
 
317 WILLIS

1. I LEFT it all with Jesus
Long ago;
All my sins I brought Him,
And my woe.
When by faith I saw Him
On the tree,
Heard His still small whisper,
" 'Tis for thee,"
From my heart the burden 
Rolled away, Happy day!

2. I leave it all with Jesus,
 For He knows
How to steal the bitter
From life's woes;
How to gild the tear-drop 
With His smile;
Make the desert garden 
Bloom awhile.
When my weakness leaneth
On His might,
All seems light. 
 
3. I leave it all with Jesus Day by day;
Faith can firmly trust Him,
Come what may.
Hope has dropped her anchor,
Found her rest In the calm, sure haven
Of His breast.
Love esteems it heaven
To abide
At His side.

4. I leave myself with Jesus,
For He keeps
Watch o'er all His creatures,
And ne'er sleeps.
Worlds on worlds are hanging
On His hand,
Life and death are waiting
His command,
Yet His tender bosom
Makes me room; 
'Tis my home.
 


318 HAPPY DAY

1. OH happy day, that fixed my choice 
On Thee, my Saviour and my God! 
Well may this glowing heart rejoice, 
And tell its raptures all abroad.

Happy day!
When Jesus put my sins away. 
He taught me how to watch and pray, 
And live rejoicing every day;
Happy day!
When Jesus put my sins away.
 
2. 'Tis done, the great transaction's done;
I am my Lord's, and He is mine. 
He drew me and I followed on, 
Charmed to confess the voice divine.

3. Now rest, my long-divided heart, 
Fixed on this blissful centre, rest. 
With ashes who would grudge to part 
When called on angels' bread to feast ?



319 ERNAN

1. OH happy day, when first we felt
Our souls with deep contrition melt, 
And saw our sins of crimson guilt,
All cleansed by blood on Calvary spilt!

2. Oh happy day, when first Thy love 
Began our grateful hearts to move; 
And, gazing on Thy wondrous cross, 
We saw all else as worthless dross!

3. Oh happy day, oh blessed hour,
When by the Spirit's gentle power, 
We sing to God with one accord 
In praise of Jesus Christ our Lord!

4. Oh happy day, whene'er we know 
The joy of God down here below! 
Though sorrow, grief and woe assail, 
His power and love can never fail.

5. Oh happy day, when we no more
Shall grieve Thee whom our souls adore 
When sorrows, conflicts, fears shall cease 
And all our trials end in peace.

6. Oh happy day, when we shall see 
And fix our longing eyes on Thee; 
On Thee, our light, our life, our love, 
Our all below, our heaven above!

7. Oh happy day of cloudless light, 
Eternal day without a night!
Lord, when shall we its dawning see, 
And spend it all in praising Thee?

8. Come, Saviour, come, oh quickly come, 
Take us Thy waiting people home;
We long to stand around Thy throne 
And know Thee as by Thee we're known.
 
320 PALM
 
1. MY chains are snapt, the bonds of sin are broken, 
And I am free!
Oh, let the triumphs of His grace be spoken,
Who died for me!

2. O Death, O Grave, I do not dread your power,
The ransom's paid;
On Jesus, in that dark and dreadful hour,
 My guilt was laid.

3. Yes, He has borne it, borne in love unbounded
What none can know;
He passed through death, and gloriously confounded 
Our every foe.

4. And now He's risen; proclaim the joyful story—
The Lord's on high;
And we in Him are raised to endless glory,
And death defy.

5. We wait to see the Morning Star appearing
In glory bright.
This blessed hope illumes, with beams most cheering, 
The hours of night.
 


321 HALL

1. THE love that Jesus had for me 
To suffer on the cruel tree,
That I a ransomed soul might be,
Is more than tongue can tell.

His love is more than tongue can tell, 
His love is more than tongue can tell, 
The love that Jesus had for me
Is more than tongue can tell.

2. The bitter sorrow that He bore,
And oh! that crown of thorns He wore, 
That I might live for evermore,
Is more than tongue can tell.

3. The peace I have in Him, my Lord, 
Who pleads before the throne of God 
The merit of His precious blood,
Is more than tongue can tell.

4. The joy that comes when He is near, 
The rest He gives so free from fear, 
The hope in Him so bright and clear,
Is more than tongue can tell. 


322 NOTTINGHAM

1. GREAT the joy when Christians meet; 
Christian fellowship, how sweet, 
When, our theme of praise the same, 
We exalt Jehovah's name!

2. Sing we then eternal love.
Such as did the Father move.
He beheld the world undone;
Loved the world, and gave His Son.

3. Sing the Son's unbounded love, 
How He left the realms above,
To rejoin the Father's side
With a blood-bought, spotless Bride.

4. Sing we too the Spirit's love,
With our stubborn hearts He strove. 
He revealed the Son of God
And the value of His blood.

5. Sweet the thought, exceeding sweet, 
We shall soon in glory meet,
Where, the Saviour still the theme, 
We shall ever sing of Him.
 


323 REDHEAD

1. ROCK of ages, cleft for me, 
Let me hide myself in Thee! 
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy riven side which flowed, 
Be of sin the double cure,
Cleanse me from its guilt and power.

2. Not the labour of my hands
Could fulfil the law's demands; 
Could my zeal no respite know, 
Could my tears for ever flow, 
All for sin could not atone;
Thou must save, and Thou alone.

3. Nothing in my hand I bring, 
Simply to Thy cross I cling; 
Naked, come to Thee for dress, 
Helpless, look to Thee for grace; 
Hungry, thirsty still I flee, 
All-sufficient Lord, to Thee.

4. While I draw this fleeting breath,
Should mine eyelids close in death; 
When I soar to worlds unknown, 
And behold Thee on Thy throne; 
Rock of ages, cleft for me,
Still I hide myself in Thee!


324 PISGAH

1. I REST, O Christ, in Thee;
 In Thee myself I hide.
Laden with guilt and misery,
Where could I rest beside? 
'Tis on Thy meek and lowly breast
 My weary soul alone can rest.

2. Thou Holy One of God,
The Father rests in Thee, 
And in the virtue of that blood
Which speaks to Him for me.
The curse is gone; through Thee I'm blest
God rests in Thee, in Thee I rest. 

3. The slave of sin and fear,
Thy truth my bondage broke. 
My happy spirit loves to wear
Thy light and easy yoke.
Thy love which fills my grateful breast 
Makes duty joy, and labour rest.

4. Soon that bright glorious day,
The rest of God, shall come. 
Sorrow and sin shall pass away,
And I shall reach my home. 
There, of the promised land possessed, 
My soul shall know eternal rest.


325 I AM HIS

1. LOVED with everlasting love,
Led by grace that love to know; 
Spirit, breathing from above,
Thou hast taught me it is so. 
Oh, this full and perfect peace!
Oh, this transport all divine! 
In a love which cannot cease
I am His and He is mine.

2. Heaven above is softer blue,
Earth around is sweeter green; 
Something lives in every hue
Christless eyes have never seen; 
Birds with gladder songs o'erflow,
Flowers with deeper beauties shine, 
Since I know as now I know,
I am His and He is mine.
 
3. His for ever, only His;
Who the Lord and me shall part? 
Oh, with what a rest of bliss
Christ can fill the loving heart! 
Heaven and earth may fade and flee,
First-born light in gloom decline;
I with God shall ever be,
I am His and He is mine.


326 I KNOW NOT WHY

1. I KNOW not why God's wondrous grace 
To me hath been made known,
Or why, unworthy as I am,
He claimed me for His own.

But "I know whom I have believed, 
And am persuaded that He is able 
To keep that which I've committed
Unto Him against that day."

2. I know not how this saving faith 
To me He did impart;
Or how believing in His word 
Wrought peace within my heart.

3. I know not how the Spirit moves, 
Convincing men of sin,
Revealing Jesus through the word, 
Creating faith in Him.

4. I know not what of good or ill
May be reserved for me,
Of weary ways or golden days,
Before His face I see. 

5. I know not when my Lord may come;
I know not how, nor where;
If I shall pass the vale of death
Or meet Him in the air.


327 MANOAH

1. A MIND at perfect peace with God, 
Oh, what a word is this!
A sinner reconciled through blood, 
This, this indeed is peace.

2. By nature and by practice far,
How very far from God!
Yet now by grace brought nigh to Him, 
Through faith in Jesus' blood.

3. So nigh, so very nigh to God,
 I cannot nearer be;
For in the person of His Son 
I am as near as He.

4. So dear, so very dear to God,
More dear I cannot be;
The love wherewith He loves His Son, 
Such is His love to me.

5. Why should I ever anxious be,
Since such a God is mine?
He watches o'er me night and day,
And tells me," Mine is thine."
 


328 EIRENE

1. PEACE, peace, calm as a river;
Peace, peace, deep as the sea; 
Peace, peace, lasting for ever, 
Made upon Golgotha's tree.
Peace, peace, great peace! 
Made upon Golgotha's tree.

2. Rest, rest, ne'er to be broken;
Rest, rest, happy, profound; 
Rest, rest, Christ hath it spoken; 
Rest in Himself only found.
Rest, rest, sweet rest! 
Rest in Himself only found.

3. Joy, joy, ever abiding;
Joy, joy, perfect and sure; 
Joy, joy, restful, confiding; 
Joy which shall ever endure.
Joy, joy, glad joy! 
Joy which shall ever endure.

4. Home, home, glorious dwelling;
Home, home, Jesus is there. 
Bliss, bliss, passing all telling,
Soon all the ransomed will share.
Home, home, sweet home! 
Soon all the ransomed will share.
 


329 IT IS WELL

1. WHEN peace, like a river, attendeth my way,
When sorrows, like sea-billows, roll,
Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say, 
"It is well, it is well with my soul."

It is well, it is well with my soul.

2. Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come, 
Let this blest assurance control—
That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate, 
And His blood hath been shed for my soul.

3. My sin, oh the bliss of this glorious thought! 
My sin, not in part, but the whole
Was nailed to His cross, and I bear it no more; 
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

4. For me be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live! 
If Jordan above me shall roll
No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life
Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.
 
5. But Lord, 'tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait; 
The sky, not the grave, is our goal.
Oh voice of archangel! oh shout of the Lord! 
Blessed hope, blessed rest of my soul!


330 NONE BUT CHRIST

1. O CHRIST, in Thee my soul hath found, 
And found in Thee alone,
The peace, the joy I sought so long, 
The bliss till now unknown.

Now none but Christ can satisfy,
None other name for me;
There's love and life and lasting joy,
Lord Jesus, found in Thee.

2. I sighed for rest and happiness;
I yearned for them, not Thee.
But while I passed the Saviour by,
His love laid hold on me.

3. I tried the broken cisterns, Lord, 
But ah, the waters failed!
E'en as I stooped to drink they fled, 
And mocked me as I wailed.

4. The pleasures lost I sadly mourned, 
But never wept for Thee,
Till grace the sightless eyes received, 
Thy loveliness to see.
 


331 WYE VALLEY

1. LIKE a river glorious is God's perfect peace, 
Over all victorious in its bright increase; 
Perfect, yet it floweth fuller every day; 
Perfect, yet it groweth deeper all the way.

Stayed upon Jehovah, hearts are fully blest; 
Finding, as He promised, perfect peace and rest.

2. Hidden in the hollow of His blessed hand,
Never foe can follow, never traitor stand. 
Not a surge of worry, not a shade of care, 
Not a blast of hurry, touch the spirit there.

3. Every joy or trial falleth from above,
Traced upon life's dial by the Sun of love. 
We may trust Him fully all for us to do,
They who trust Him wholly find Him wholly true.


332 PAX TECUM

1. PEACE, perfect peace, in this dark world of sin? 
The blood of Jesus whispers peace within.

2. Peace, perfect peace, by thronging duties pressed? 
To do the will of Jesus, this is rest.

3. Peace, perfect peace, with sorrows surging round? 
On Jesus' bosom nought but peace is found.

4. Peace, perfect peace, with loved ones far away? 
In Jesus' keeping we are safe and they.

5. Peace, perfect peace, our future all unknown? 
Jesus we know, and He is on the throne.

6. Peace, perfect peace, death shadowing us and ours? 
Jesus has vanquished death and all its powers.

7. It is enough, earth's struggles soon shall cease, 
And Jesus call to heaven's perfect peace.
 


333 IRISH

1. LET us rejoice in Christ the Lord,
Who makes our cause His own;
The hope that's built upon His word
Can ne'er be overthrown.

2. Though many foes beset us round, 
And feeble is our arm,
Our life is hid with Christ in God, 
Beyond the reach of harm.

3. Weak as we are we shall not faint, 
Or, fainting, shall not fail;
Jesus, the strength of every saint, 
For ever must prevail.

4. Though now He's unperceived by sense, 
Faith sees Him always near,
A guide, a glory, a defence,
To save from every fear.

5. As surely as He overcame,
And conquered death and sin,
So surely those who trust His name 
Shall all His triumph win.


334 SOUTHGATE

1. TROUBLED souls the Saviour seeking,
Peace, peace be still. 
'Tis the Lord Himself is speaking,
Peace, peace be still. 
Long before the world's foundation 
God secured a full salvation; 
Happy people, chosen nation;
Peace, peace be still.

2. 'Tis the blood of Christ hath spoken,
Peace, peace be still. 
The destroyer sees the token,
Peace, peace be still. 
On God's word we boldly venture, 
All our hopes in Jesus centre,
Into rest our souls can enter;
Peace, peace be still.

3. Great the calm the Saviour spreadeth,
Peace, peace be still. 
Whatsoe'er your spirit dreadeth,
Peace, peace be still. 
Though with mighty foes engaging, 
War with sin and Satan waging, 
Storms of trial fiercely raging,
Peace, peace be still.

4. Jesus walks upon the ocean,
Peace, peace be still.
He shall hush its loud commotion,
Peace, peace be still. 
Soon shall end our days of sighing, 
Pain and sorrow, death and crying; 
Till that hour on God relying,
Peace, peace be still.
 


335 DISMISSAL

1. HAPPY they who trust in Jesus,
Sweet their portion is and sure. 
While the foe on others seizes,
He will keep His own secure.
Happy people!
Happy though despised and poor.

2. Since His love and mercy found us,
We are precious in His sight.
Thousands now may fall around us,
Thousands more be put to flight,
But His presence
Keeps us safe by day and night.

3. Lo, our Saviour never slumbers,
Ever watchful in His care.
Though we cannot boast of numbers,
 In His strength secure we are. 
Sweet their portion
Who our Saviour's kindness share.

4. As the bird beneath her feathers
Guards the object of her care, 
So the Lord His people gathers,
Spreads His wings and hides them there.
Thus protected,
All our foes we boldly dare. 
 


336 KOCHER

1. O HAPPY band of pilgrims
If onward ye will tread,
Christ Jesus as your Master,
Christ Jesus as your Head.

2. Oh, happy if ye labour
As He did toil for men; 
Oh, happy if ye hunger
As He did hunger then.

3. The cross that Christ has carried, 
He carried as your due;
But now the crown He weareth,
And you may wear one too.

4. The faith by which ye see Him,
The hope in which ye yearn,
The love that through all troubles
To Him alone will turn;

5. The trials that beset you,
The sorrows ye endure, 
The manifold temptations
That here we cannot cure;

6. What are they but His jewels
Of right celestial worth? 
What are they but a ladder
Set up to heaven on earth?

7. O happy band of pilgrims,
Look upward to the skies, 
Where such a light affliction
Shall win so great a prize.
 


337 GLASGOW

1. WHEN Israel, by divine command. 
The pathless desert trod,
They found through all that barren land 
A sure resource in God.

2. A cloudy pillar marked the road
And screened them from the heat;
 From the hard rock the water flowed,
And manna was their meat.

3. Like them we have a rest in view
Secure from adverse powers;
Like them we pass a desert too,
But Israel's God is ours.

4. His word a light before us sheds,
By which our path we see;
His love a banner o'er our heads
From harm preserves us free.

5. Jesus, the Bread of life, is given
To be our daily food,
And from the Rock that once was riven 
We drink the streams of God.

6. And soon we'll reach our heavenly rest
And lay our burdens down;
We'll join the myriads of the blest
Who there surround the throne. 


338 SALZBURG

1. O GOD of Bethel, by whose hand 
Thy people still are fed,
Who through this weary pilgrimage 
Hast all our fathers led;

2. Our prayers, our praise, we now present 
Before the throne of grace;
God of our fathers, be the God
Of each succeeding race.

3. Through each perplexing path of life
Our wandering footsteps guide; 
Give us each day our daily bread,
And raiment fit provide.

4. Oh, spread Thy covering wings around 
Till all our wanderings cease,
And at our Father's loved abode
Our souls arrive in peace.

5. Such blessings from Thy gracious hand 
Our humble prayers implore,
And Thou shalt be our chosen God 
And portion evermore.
 


339 CWM RHONDDA

1. GUIDE US, O Thou great Jehovah,
Pilgrims through this barren land; 
We are weak, but Thou art mighty,
Hold us with Thy powerful hand.
Bread of heaven,
Feed us now and evermore.

2. Open wide the living fountain 
Whence the healing waters flow;
Be Thyself our fiery pillar
All the desert journey through.
Strong Deliverer,
Be Thou still our strength and shield.

3. While we tread this vale of sorrow, 
May we in Thy love abide.
Keep us, O Thou gracious Saviour,
Cleaving closely to Thy side;
Still relying
On our Father's changeless love.

4. Saviour, come, we long to see Thee,
Long to dwell with Thee above, 
And to know in full communion
All the sweetness of Thy love.
Come, Lord Jesus,
Take Thy waiting people home. 


340 SAVIOUR, LEAD US

1. SAVIOUR, through the desert lead us, 
Without Thee we cannot go;
Thou from cruel chains hast freed us,
Thou hast laid the tyrant low;
Let Thy presence
Cheer us all the desert through.

2. With a price Thy love has bought us,
Saviour, what a love is Thine!
Hitherto Thy power has brought us, 
Power and love in Thee combine.
Lord of glory.
Ever on Thy people shine.

3. Through the desert, waste and cheerless,
Though our destined journey lie, 
Rendered by Thy presence fearless,
We may every foe defy.
Nought shall move us,
While we see Thee, Saviour, nigh.

4. When we halt, no track discovering, 
Fearful lest we go astray,
O'er our path Thy pillar hovering, 
Fire by night and cloud by day, 
Shall direct us;
Thus we shall not miss our way.

5. When we hunger Thou wilt feed us,
Manna shall our camp surround; 
Faint and thirsty Thou wilt heed us,
Streams shall from the rock abound.
Happy people!
What a Saviour we have found!
 


341 LUX EOI

1. RISE, my soul, thy God directs thee,
Stranger hands no more impede;
Pass thou on, His hand protects thee,
Strength that has the captive freed. 
Is the wilderness before thee,
Desert lands where drought abounds?
Heavenly springs shall there restore thee,
Fresh from God's exhaustless tides.

2. Light divine surrounds thy going, 
God Himself shall mark thy way; 
Secret blessings richly flowing
Lead to everlasting day.
God, thine everlasting portion,
Feeds thee with the mighty's meat; 
Price of Egypt's hard extortion, 
Egypt's food, no more to eat.

3. Art thou weaned from Egypt's pleasures?
God in secret thee shall keep;
There unfold His hidden treasures,
There, His love's exhaustless deep. 
In the desert God will teach thee
What the God that thou hast found; 
Patient, gracious, powerful, holy;
All His grace shall there abound.

4. On to Canaan's rest still wending,
E'en thy wants and woes shall bring 
Suited grace from high descending;
Thou shalt taste of mercy's spring. 
Though thy way be long and dreary,
Eagle strength He'll still renew; 
Garments fresh and foot unweary
Tell how God has brought thee through.

5. When to Canaan's long-loved dwelling
Love divine thy foot shall bring,
There with shouts of triumph swelling
Zion's songs in rest to sing,
There no stranger-God shall meet thee
(Stranger thou in courts above); 
He who to His rest shall greet thee
Greets thee with a well-known love.


342 STEINER

1. I'm a pilgrim bound for glory,
I'm a pilgrim going home;
Come and hear me tell my story, 
All who love the Saviour, come.

2. I will tell you what induced me
For the better land to start 
'Twas the Saviour's loving kindness
Overcame and won my heart.

3. Faint and weary He has brought me 
To the fountain of His love;
Showed me how His blood had bought me, 
Sealed my pardon from above.

4. Through the wilderness He's led me,
Strength in weakness He's bestowed; 
With the bread of life He's fed me,
Streams of living water flowed.
 


343 MARCHING

1. FROM the cross unto the glory,
Through the darksome vale of tears; 
Trusting, serving and obeying,
It may be for days or years.

2. From the cross unto the glory,
With the Saviour nigh at hand; 
Sooner, later, all arriving
In the pleasant promised land.

3. From the cross unto the glory,
With a happy pilgrim band;
Bright or cloudy be the pathway,
By His grace we soon shall land.

4. To the cross down from the glory,
First He came to set us free; 
Soon He comes, and raised in glory 
We shall ever with Him be.

5. From the cross unto the glory,
Him as Lord I gladly own;
Telling all the wondrous story
Of the One who wears the crown.


344 HIDING IN THEE

1. THROUGH the dark path of sorrow
Which Jesus has trod, 
Thy feeble ones journey,
O Father, our God.
And the thick clouds that gather
But turn us away
From the waste, howling desert,
Where He could not stay. 

2. From the cold world that knoweth
And loveth its own, 
Where Jesus was hated,
Rejected, unknown, 
We will cheerfully hasten,
Rejoicing to be
Counted worthy to suffer,
 Lord Jesus, for Thee.

3. In the fierce hour that trieth
The children of men, 
In the hour of temptation,
Lord, succour us then; 
Let the weak and the feeble
Find under Thine arm,
 In the blast of the terri-ble,
Shelter from storm.

4. When the proud are exalted
And seated on high,
When trouble and desperate 
Sorrow are nigh,
When the hearts of all others
Are failing for fear,
Then the Lord is our refuge,
Secure we rest here.

5. We wait for His coming, 
We long for that day;
Bright Star of the morning,
Thou wilt not delay;
Let the purchased possession
Be gathered to Thee,
Let the groaning creation 
From sorrow be free.

The last syllable of verse 3, line 7, and of verse 4, line 3, are to be sung to the first note of the following line.
 


345 FATHERLAND

1. WE are but strangers here, 
Heaven is our home. 
Earth is a desert drear,
Heaven is our home. 
Danger and sorrow stand 
Round us on every hand; 
Heaven is our fatherland,
Heaven is our home.

2. What though the tempests rage? 
Heaven is our home. 
Short is our pilgrimage,
Heaven is our home. 
And time's wild wintry blast 
Soon will be overpast;
We shall reach home at last, 
Heaven is our home.

3. There at the Saviour's side, 
Heaven is our home. 
We shall be glorified,
Heaven is our home. 
There with the good and blest, 
Those we loved most and best, 
We shall for ever rest,
Heaven is our home.

4. Therefore we murmur not,
Heaven is our home, 
Whate'er our earthly lot,
Heaven is our home. 
For we shall surely stand
There at the Lord's right hand; 
Heaven is our fatherland, 
Heaven is our home.
 


346 WENTWORTH

1. OUR God, we thank Thee, who hast made 
The earth so bright,
So full of splendour and of joy,
Beauty and light;
So many glorious things are here,
Noble and right.

2. We thank Thee, too, that Thou hast made 
Joy to abound,
So many gentle thoughts and deeds, 
Circling us round,
That in the darkest spot of earth
Some love is found.

3. We thank Thee more, that all our joy
Is touched with pain,
That shadows fall on brightest hours,
That thorns remain;
So that earth's bliss may be our guide, 
And not our chain.

4. For Thou who knowest, Lord, how soon 
Our weak heart clings,
Hast given us joys, tender and true, 
Yet all with wings,
So that we see, gleaming on high,
Diviner things.

5.We thank Thee, Lord, that Thou hast kept
The best in store;
We have enough, but not too much
To long for more;
A yearning for a deeper peace
Not known before.
 


347 HASTEN

1. RISE up and hasten, my soul, haste along,
And speed on thy journey with hope and with song. 
Home, home is nearing, 'tis coming into view;
A little more of toiling, and then to earth adieu.

Come then, come, and raise your joyful song,
Ye children of the wilderness, your time cannot be long. 
Home, home, home! oh why should we delay?
The morn of heaven is dawning; we're near the break of day.

2. Why should we linger, when heaven lies before? 
Earth's fast receding, and soon will be no more;
Its joys and its treasures, which once here we knew,
Now never more can charm us with such a goal in view.

3. Loved ones are with Him, they've passed on before; 
Resting in glory, they weary are no more;
Earth's toils are ended, now nothing more but joy,
And praises loud ascending, their ever glad employ.

4. No condemnation! how blessed is the word!
No separation! for ever with the Lord!
By His blood He bought them, cleansed their every stain;
With rapture now they praise Him, the Lamb that once was slain.

5. Soon we shall join them, see Him with these eyes; 
Sing Hallelujah! triumphant in the skies;
He will be with us, who loved us long before, 
Lord Jesus, precious Saviour, is ours for evermore.
 


348 WHITHER, PILGRIMS?

1. WHITHER, pilgrims, are you going,
Going each with staff in hand? 
We are going on a journey,
Going at our Lord's command. 
Over hills and plains and valleys 
We are going to His palace,
Going to the better land.

2. Tell us, pilgrims, what you hope for 
In that far-off better land?
Spotless robes and crowns of glory 
From the Saviour's loving hand.
We shall drink of life's clear river,
We shall dwell with God for ever,
In that bright and better land.

3. Fear ye not the way so lonely,
Ye a feeble little band?
No, for friends unseen are near us,
Angels bright around us stand;
Christ, our Leader, walks beside us,
He will guard and He will guide us,
Going to the better land. 


349 DA CHRISTUS

1. FAINT not, Christian, though the road 
Leading to thy blest abode
Darksome be and dangerous too; 
Christ, thy Guide, will bring thee through.

2. Faint not, Christian, though in rage 
Satan doth thy soul engage;
Take thee faith's anointed shield, 
Bear it to the battlefield.

3. Faint not, Christian, though the world 
Has its hostile flag unfurled;
Hold the cross of Jesus fast, 
Thou shalt overcome at last.

4. Faint not, Christian, though within 
There's a heart so prone to sin; 
Christ, the Lord, is over all, 
Trusting Him thou wilt not fall.

5. Faint not, Christian, though thy God 
Smite thee with a chastening rod; 
Smite He must with Father's care 
That He may His love declare.

6. Faint not, Christian, Christ is near, 
Soon in glory He'll appear;
Thou shalt end thy toil and strife, 
Death be swallowed up of life.
 


350 DENT DALE

1. OFT in danger, oft in woe,
Onward, Christians, onward go!
Bear the toil, maintain the strife, 
Strengthened with the bread of life.

2. Let not sorrow dim your eye,
Soon shall every tear be dry;
Let not fear your course impede,
Great your strength, if great your need.

3. Let your drooping hearts be glad, 
March in heavenly armour clad; 
Fight, nor think the battle long, 
Soon shall victory wake your song.

4. Onward then to glory move,
More than conquerors ye may prove; 
Though opposed by many a foe, 
Onward, Christians, onward go!

5. Hymns of glory and of praise, 
Father, unto Thee we raise, 
Praise unto Thine only Son, 
And the Spirit, Three in One.


351 MY FATHER KNOWS

1. I'm a pilgrim and a stranger,
Rough and thorny is the road; 
Often in the midst of danger,
But it leads to God.
Clouds and darkness oft distress me,
Great and many are my foes, 
Anxious care and thoughts perplex me,
But my Father knows.

2. Oh, how sweet is this assurance
Midst the conflict and the strife, 
Although sorrows past endurance
Follow me through life!
Home in prospect still can cheer me,
Yes, and give me sweet repose,
While I feel His presence near me;
For my Father knows.

3. Yes, He sees and knows me daily,
Watches over me in love,
Sends me help when foes assail me,
Bids me look above.
Soon my journey will be ended;
Life is drawing to a close; 
I shall then be well attended;
This my Father knows.

4. I shall then with joy behold Him,
Face to face my Father see;
Fall with rapture and adore Him,
For His love to me.
Nothing more shall then distress me
In that land of sweet repose;
Jesus stands engaged to bless me,
This my Father knows.
 


352 NAVARRE

1. I JOURNEY through a desert drear and wild,
Yet is my heart by such sweet thoughts beguiled 
Of Him on whom I lean, my strength, my stay, 
I can forget the sorrows of the way.

2. Thoughts of His love, the root of every grace 
That finds in this poor heart a dwelling place; 
The sunshine of my soul, than day more bright, 
And my calm pillow of repose by night.

3. Thoughts of His sojourn in this vale of tears; 
The tale of love unfolded in those years
Of sinless suffering and patient grace,
I love again and yet again to trace.

4.Thoughts of His death upon Golgotha's tree, 
The spotless Holy One made sin for me. 
How fathomless the love He then displayed, 
When for my soul He full atonement made!

5. Thoughts of His glory; on the cross I gaze, 
And there behold its sad yet healing rays; 
Beacon of hope which, lifted up on high,
Illumes with heavenly light the tear-dimmed eye.

6. Thoughts of His coming; for that joyful day
In patient hope I watch and wait and pray.
The day draws nigh, the midnight shadows flee; 
Oh, what a sunrise will that advent be!

7. Thus while I journey on my Lord to meet, 
My thoughts and meditations are so sweet
Of Him on whom I lean, my strength, my stay, 
I can forget the sorrows of the way.
 


353 OLD 120TH
 
1. "I GAVE My life for thee; 
My precious blood was shed,
That thou might'st ransomed be, 
And quickened from the dead.
I gave My life for thee;
What hast thou given for Me?

2. "I spent long years for thee,
 In weariness and woe,
That an eternity
Of joy thou mightest know.
I spent long years for thee; 
Hast thou spent one for Me?

3. "My Father's home of light, 
My rainbow-circled throne,
I left, for earthly night,
For wanderings sad and lone.
I left it all for thee;
Hast thou left aught for Me?

4. "I suffered much for thee, 
More than thy tongue can tell, 
Of bitterest agony
To rescue thee from hell.
I suffered much for thee;
What canst thou bear for Me?

5. "And I have brought to thee, 
Down from My home above, 
Salvation full and free,
My pardon and My love. 
Great gifts I brought to thee;
What hast thou brought to Me?" 

6. Oh, let my life be given,
My years for Thee be spent; 
World fetters all be riven, 
And joy with suffering blent. 
What Thou hast done for me 
Demands my all for Thee.


354 MAIDSTONE

1. TAKE my life, and let it be 
Consecrated, Lord, to Thee;
Take my moments and my days, 
Let them flow in ceaseless praise; 
Take my hands, and let them move 
At the impulse of Thy love;
Take my feet, and let them be 
Swift and beautiful for Thee.

2. Take my voice, and let me sing
Always, only for the King; 
Take my lips, and let them be
 Filled with messages from Thee; 
Take my silver and my gold, 
Not a mite would I withhold; 
Take my intellect, and use
Every power as Thou shalt choose.

3. Take my will, and make it Thine, 
Let it be no longer mine;
Take my heart—it is Thine own, 
Let it be Thy royal throne;
Take my love, Lord, I would pour 
At Thy feet its treasure-store; 
Take myself, and let me be
Ever, only, all for Thee.
 


355 DRAW ME NEARER

1. I AM Thine, O Lord, I have heard Thy voice, 
And it told Thy love to me;
But I long to rise in the arms of faith
And be closer drawn to Thee.

Draw me nearer, blessed Lord,
To the cross where Christ has died; 
Draw me nearer, blessed Lord,
To His precious, wounded side.

2. Consecrate me now to Thy service, Lord,
By the power of grace divine;
Let my soul look up with a stedfast hope,
And my will be lost in Thine.

3. Oh, the pure delight of a single hour
That before Thy throne I spend,
When I kneel in prayer, and with Thee, my God, 
I commune as friend with friend!

4. There are depths of love that I cannot know 
Till I cross the narrow sea;
There are heights of joy that I may not reach
Till I rest in peace with Thee.
 


356 ARABIA
 
1. FATHER, I know that all my life
Is portioned out for me;
The changes that are sure to come
I do not fear to see.
I ask Thee for a present mind,
Intent on pleasing Thee.

2. I ask Thee for a thoughtful love,
Through constant watching wise, 
To meet the glad with joyful smiles,
And wipe the weeping eyes; 
A heart at leisure from itself,
To soothe and sympathise.

3. I would not have the restless will
That hurries to and fro,
That seeks for some great thing to do,
Or secret thing to know;
I would be treated as a child, 
And guided where to go.

4. Wherever in the world I am,
In whatsoe'er estate,
I have a fellowship with hearts
To keep and cultivate; 
A work of lowly love to do
For Him on whom I wait. 

5. I ask Thee for the daily strength
To none that ask denied,
A mind to blend with outward life
While keeping at Thy side; 
Content to fill a little space,
If Christ be glorified.

6. And if some things I do not ask
Amongst my blessings be,
I'd have my spirit filled the more
With grateful love to Thee;
More careful not to serve Thee much,
But please Thee perfectly.

7. The thorns besetting every path
Call for a patient care; 
There is a cross in every lot
And earnest need for prayer;
But lowly hearts that lean on Thee 
Are happy anywhere.

8. In service which Thy will appoints
There are no bonds for me;
My inmost heart would know the truth
That sets Thy children free 
"A life of self-renouncing love
Is one of liberty."



357 TAKE TIME

1. TAKE time to be holy, speak oft with thy Lord;
Abide in Him always, and feed on His word.
Make friends of God's children, help those who are weak, 
Forgetting in nothing His blessing to seek.

2. Take time to be holy, the world rushes on; 
Spend much time in secret with Jesus alone. 
By looking to Jesus, like Him thou shalt be; 
Thy friends in thy conduct His likeness shall see.

3. Take time to be holy, let Him be thy Guide; 
And run not before Him, whatever betide; 
In joy or in sorrow still follow thy Lord,
And looking to Jesus, still trust in His word.

4. Take time to be holy, be calm in thy soul,
Each thought and each temper beneath His control. 
Thus led by His Spirit and filled with His love 
Thou soon shalt be fitted for service above.
 


358 ALMSGIVING

1. O LORD of heaven and earth and sea, 
To Thee all praise and glory be; 
How shall we show our love to Thee,
Who givest all?

2. Thou didst not spare Thine only Son, 
But gav'st Him for a world undone, 
And freely with the blessed One
Thou givest all.

3. We lose what on ourselves we spend; 
We have as treasure without end
 Whatever, Lord, to Thee we lend,
Who givest all;

4. To Thee, from whom we all derive 
Our life, our gifts, our power to give 
Oh, may we ever with Thee live,
Who givest all!
 


359 HESPERUS

1. Go, labour on, spend and be spent ; 
Thy joy to do the Father's will.
It is the way the Master went;
Should not the servant tread it still?

2. Go, labour on; tis not for nought; 
Thine earthly loss is heavenly gain.
Men heed thee, love thee, praise thee not; 
The Master praises; what are men?

3. Go, labour on; your hands are weak, 
Your knees are faint, your soul cast down ; 
Yet falter not; the prize you seek
Is near, a kingdom and a crown.

4. Go, labour on while it is day;
The world's dark night is hastening on. 
Speed, speed thy work, cast sloth away; 
It is not thus that souls are won.

5. Men die in darkness at your side, 
Without a hope to cheer the tomb. 
Take up the torch and wave it wide,
The torch that lights time's thickest gloom.

6. Toil on, faint not, keep watch and pray, 
Be wise the erring soul to win;
Go forth into the world's highway, 
Compel the wanderer to come in.

7. Toil on, and in thy toil rejoice;
For toil comes rest, for exile home. 
Soon shalt thou hear the Master's voice, 
The midnight cry, " Behold, I come!"


360 I SHALL BE SATISFIED

1. Soul, of mine, in earthly temple,
Why not here content abide? 
Why art thou for ever pleading,
Why art thou not satisfied?

I shall be satisfied
When I awake in His likeness.

2. Soul of mine, my heart is clinging
To the earth's fair pomp and pride; 
Ah, why dost thou thus reprove me,
Why art thou not satisfied?

3. Soul of mine, must I surrender, 
See myself as crucified,
Turn from all of earth's ambition, 
That thou mayest be satisfied?

4. Soul of mine, continue pleading;
Sin rebuke and folly chide; 
I must bear the cross of Jesus
That thou mayest be satisfied.
 


361 DAY OF REST

1. LORD JESUS, 'tis my purpose
To serve Thee to the end; 
Be Thou for ever near me,
My Master and my Friend.
I shall not fear the battle
If Thou art by my side,
Nor wander from the pathway
If Thou wilt be my Guide.

2. Oh, let me know Thee near me; 
The world is ever near ;
I see the sights that dazzle,
The tempting sounds I hear. 
My foes are ever near me,
Around me and within;
Lord Jesus, draw Thou nearer,
And shield my soul from sin.

3. Oh, let me hear Thee speaking
In accents clear and still,
Above the storms of passion,
The murmurs of self-will. 
Oh, speak to reassure me,
To hasten or control;
Oh, speak and make me listen, 
Thou Guardian of my soul.

4. Lord Jesus, Thou hast promised
To all who follow Thee,
That where Thou art in glory,
There shall Thy servant be. 
Lord Jesus, 'tis my purpose
To serve Thee to the end; 
Oh, give me grace to follow,
My Master and my Friend.
 
5. Oh, let me see Thy footmarks, 
And in them plant mine own. 
My hope to follow duly
Is in Thy strength alone;
Oh guide me, call me, draw me,
Uphold me to the end,
And then in heaven receive me,
My Saviour and my Friend.
 


362 NOT NOW
 
1. NOT now, My child; a little more rough tossing, 
A little longer on the billows' foam,
A few more journeyings in the desert darkness, 
And then the sunshine of thy Father's home.

2. Not now; for I have wanderers in the distance,
And thou must call them in with patient love. 
Not now; for I have sheep upon the mountains,
And thou must follow them where'er they rove.

3. Not now; for I have loved ones, sad and weary—
Wilt thou not cheer them with a kindly smile?
Sick ones, who need thee in their lonely sorrows—
Wilt thou not tend them yet a little while?

4. Not now; for wounded hearts are sorely bleeding,
And thou must teach those widowed hearts to sing. 
Not now; for orphans' tears are thickly falling,
They must be gathered 'neath some sheltering wing.

5. Not now; for hell's eternal gulf is yawning,
And souls are perishing in hopeless sin; 
Jerusalem's bright gates are standing open;
Go to the banished ones and fetch them in.

6. Go with the name of Jesus to the dying,
And speak that name in all its living power.
Why should thy fainting heart grow chill and weary?
Canst thou not watch with Me one little hour?

7. One little hour; and then the glorious crowning,
The golden harp-strings and the victor's palm. 
One little hour; and then the "Hallelujah,"
Eternity's long, deep, thanksgiving psalm!
 


363 MORE TO FOLLOW 

1. HAVE you on the Lord believed? 
Still there's more to follow.
Of His grace have you received? 
Still there's more to follow.
Oh the grace the Father shows! 
Still there's more to follow.
Freely He His grace bestows, 
Still there's more to follow.

More and more, more and more,
Always more to follow;
Oh His matchless, boundless love ! 
Still there's more to follow.

2. Have you felt the Saviour near? 
Still there's more to follow.
Does His blessed presence cheer?
Still there's more to follow.
Oh, the love Christ Jesus shows! 
Still there's more to follow.
Freely He His love bestows; 
Still there's more to follow.

3. Have you felt the Spirit's power?
Still there's more to follow. 
Falling like the gentle shower?
Still there's more to follow. 
Oh, the power the Spirit shows!
Still there's more to follow. 
Freely He His power bestows;
Still there's more to follow.
 


364 CHALDEA

1. HARK, the voice of Jesus calling,
"Who will go and work to-day?
Fields are white and harvest waiting,
Who will bear the sheaves away?" 
Loud and strong the Master calleth,
Rich reward He offers thee;
Who will answer, gladly saying, 
"Here am I, send me, send me?"

2. If you cannot cross the ocean
And the heathen lands explore, 
You can here, to needy sinners,
Tell the gospel at your door. 
If to waiting crowds you cannot
Preach with eloquence the word, 
You can give the printed message,
Gladly scatter for the Lord. 
 
3. If your tongue is not like angels',
If you cannot preach like Paul,
You can tell the Saviour's goodness,
You can say He died for all. 
If you cannot rouse the wicked
With the judgment's dread alarms, 
You can lead the little children
To the Saviour's waiting arms. 

4. If your place is not the watchman's,
Standing high on Zion's wall,
Pointing out the path to heaven,
Offering life and peace to all,
With your prayers and with your offerings
You can do what God commands—
You can be like Hur and Aaron,
Holding up the prophet's hands.

5. If among the older people
You may not be apt to teach,
"Feed the lambs," said Christ the Shepherd, 
Place the food within their reach;
And it may be that some children
You have led with trembling hand, 
Will be found among your jewels
When you reach the better land.
 

6. Let none hear you idly saying, 
"There is nothing I can do,"
While the souls of men are dying,
And the Master calls for you.
Take the task He gives you gladly, 
Let His work your pleasure be;
Answer gladly when He calleth 
"Here am I, send me, send me."
 


365 CRANBROOK

1. O CHRIST, Thou heavenly Lamb, 
Joy of the Father's heart,
Now let Thy love my soul inflame: 
Fresh power to me impart.

2. Power to know the loss 
Suffered, O Lord, by Thee;
Power to glory in the cross 
Thou didst endure for me.

3. Power to feel Thy love, 
And all its depths to know;
Power to fix the heart above, 
And die to all below.

4. Power to keep the eye
For ever fixed on Thee; 
Power to lift the warning cry 
To souls from wrath to flee.

5. Power lost souls to win 
From Satan's mighty hold; 
Power the wanderers to bring 
Back to the heavenly fold.

6. Power to watch, and pray, 
"Lord Jesus, quickly come;" 
Power to hail the happy day, 
Destined to bear me home.

7. Lord Jesus, then to me
Power divine impart
To swell redemption's song to Thee,
 For worthy, Lord, Thou art.
 


366 MOSCOW (DACTYLIC)

1. THOU, whose almighty word 
Chaos and darkness heard,
And took their flight, 
Hear us, we humbly pray, 
And where the gospel day 
Sheds not its glorious ray
Let there be light.

2. Thou, who didst come to bring 
On Thy redeeming wing 
Healing and sight,
Be pleased, Lord, to unbind 
Sin's captives, sick in mind; 
And to the inly blind
Let there be light.

3. Spirit of truth and love, 
Life-giving, holy Dove,
Speed forth Thy flight; 
Move on the waters' face 
By Thine almighty grace, 
And in earth's darkest place
Let there be light.

4. Blessed and Holy Three, 
Thou glorious Trinity,
Wisdom, Love, Might; 
Boundless as ocean's tide 
Rolling in fullest pride, 
O'er the world far and wide,
Let there be light.
 


367 MOUNT EPHRAIM

1. REVIVE Thy work, O Lord,
Thy mighty arm make bare.
Speak with the voice which wakes the dead ; 
First make Thy people hear.

2. Revive Thy work, O Lord,
Disturb this sleep of death.
Quicken the smouldering embers, 
Lord, By Thine almighty breath.

3. Revive Thy work, O Lord,
Create soul-thirst for Thee.
And hungering for the bread of life, 
Oh, may our spirits be!

4. Revive Thy work, O Lord, 
Exalt Thy precious name.
And by the Spirit, Lord, our love 
For Thee and Thine inflame.

5. Revive Thy work, O Lord, 
Give power unto Thy word;
Grant that Thy blessed gospel may
In living faith be heard.

6. Revive Thy work, O Lord,
And give refreshing showers.
The glory, Lord, shall be Thine own,
The blessing shall be ours. Amen. 


368 OWERS

1. "THERE shall be showers of blessing," 
This is the promise of love;
There shall be seasons refreshing,
Sent from the Saviour above.

Showers of blessing,
Showers of blessing we need;
Mercy drops round us are falling,
But for the showers we plead.

2. "There shall be showers of blessing," 
Precious reviving again;
Over the hills and the valleys,
Sound of abundance of rain.

3. "There shall be showers of blessing," 
Send them upon us, O Lord.
Grant to us now a refreshing;
Humbly we plead Thine own word.


369 PENTECOST

1. FIGHT the good fight with all thy might; 
Christ is thy strength and Christ thy right. 
Lay hold on life, and it shall be
Thy joy and crown eternally.

2. Run the straight race, through God's good grace;
Lift up thine eyes, and seek His face. 
Life with its path before thee lies,
Christ is the way and Christ the prize.
 
3. Cast care aside, upon thy Guide
Lean, and His mercy will provide. 
Trust, and thy trusting soul shall prove 
Christ is its life and Christ its love.

4. Faint not nor fear, His arm is near;
He changeth not, and thou art dear. 
Only believe, thou soon shalt see 
Christ who is all in all to thee.
 


370 WAKE

1. HARK, 'tis the watchman's cry, 
Wake, brethren, wake; 
Jesus, our Lord, is nigh,
Wake, brethren, wake. 
Sleep is for sons of night,
We are children of the light, 
Ours is the glory bright,
Wake, brethren, wake.

2. Call to each waking band,
Watch, brethren, watch; 
Clear is our Lord's command,
Watch, brethren, watch. 
Be ye as men that wait
Always at the Master's gate,
E'en though the hour seem late, 
Watch, brethren, watch.

3. Heed we the Steward's call,
Work, brethren, work; 
There's room enough for all,
Work, brethren, work. 
This vineyard of the Lord
Constant labour doth afford; 
Ours is a sure reward,
Work, brethren, work.

4. Heed we the Shepherd's voice,
Pray, brethren, pray; 
Would we His heart rejoice?
Pray, brethren, pray. 
Sin calls for constant fear,
Weakness needs the Strong One near; 
Long as we struggle here,
Pray, brethren, pray.
 
5. Now sound the final chord,
Praise, brethren, praise; Thrice holy is our Lord,
Praise, brethren, praise. 
What more befits the tongues 
Soon to lead the angels' songs, 
While heaven the note prolongs?
Praise, brethren, praise.
 


371 WORK

1. WORK, for the night is coming,
Work through the morning hours; 
Work while the dew is sparkling,
Work 'mid springing flowers;
Work when the day grows brighter,
Work in the glowing sun;
Work, for the night is coming,
When man's work is done.

2. Work, for the night is coming,
Work through the sunny noon; 
Fill brightest hours with labour,
Rest comes sure and soon. 
Give every flying minute
Something to keep in store; 
Work, for the night is coming, 
When man works no more.

3. Work, for the night is coming,
Under the sunset skies;
While their bright tints are glowing 
Work, for daylight flies.
Work till the last beam fadeth,
Fadeth to shine no more;
Work while the night is darkening,
When man's work is o'er. 
 


372 CALL THEM IN

1. CALL them in, the poor, the wretched,
Sin-stained wanderers from the fold; 
Peace and pardon freely offer;
Can you weigh their worth with gold? 
Call them in, the weak, the weary,
Laden with the doom of sin;
Bid them come and rest in Jesus;
He is waiting—call them in.

2. Call them in, the Jew, the Gentile,
Bid the strangers to the feast; 
Call them in, the rich, the noble,
From the highest to the least;
Forth the Father runs to meet them,
He hath all their sorrows seen; 
Robe and ring and royal sandals
Wait the lost ones—call them in.

3. Call them in, the broken-hearted,
Cowering 'neath the brand of shame; 
Speak love's message, low and tender,
" 'Twas for sinners Jesus came." 
See the shadows lengthen round us,
Soon the day-dawn will begin;
Can you leave them lost and lonely?
Christ is waiting—call them in.
 


373 HEBER

1. FROM Greenland's icy mountains,
From India's coral strand,
Where Afric's sunny fountains
Roll down their golden sand; 
From many an ancient river,
From many a palmy plain, 
They call us to deliver
Their souls from error's chain.

2. What though the spicy breezes
Blow soft o'er Ceylon's isle, 
Though every prospect pleases,
And only man is vile?
In vain with lavish kindness
The gifts of God are strewn; 
The heathen in his blindness,
Bows down to wood and stone.

3. Shall we whose souls are lighted
With wisdom from on high, 
Shall we, to man benighted,
The lamp of life deny? 
Salvation, oh salvation,
The joyful sound proclaim, 
Till each remotest nation
Has heard Messiah's name.

4. Waft, waft, ye winds, His story,
And you, ye waters, roll,
Till Christ shall come to gather
His own from pole to pole. 
Soon o'er redeemed creation,
The Lamb for sinners slain, 
Redeemer, King, Creator,
In bliss shall come to reign. 
 


374 LLOYD

1. LORD, speak to me, that I may speak
In living echoes of Thy tone;
As Thou has sought, so let me seek 
Thine erring children, lost and lone.

2. Oh, lead me, Lord, that I may lead
The wandering and the wavering feet; 
Oh, feed me, Lord, that I may feed
Thy hungering ones with manna sweet

3. Oh, strengthen me, that while I stand 
Firm on the rock, and strong in Thee, 
I may stretch out a loving hand
To wrestlers with the troubled sea.

4. Oh, teach me, Lord, that I may teach
The precious things Thou dost impart, 
And wing my words that they may reach
The hidden depths of many a heart.

5. Oh, give Thine own sweet rest to me, 
That I may speak, with soothing power. 
A word in season as from Thee,
To weary ones in needful hour.

6. Oh, fill me with Thy fulness, Lord,
Until my very heart o'erflow
In kindling thought and glowing word, 
Thy love to tell, Thy praise to show.

7. Oh, use me, Lord, use even me,
Just as Thou wilt, and when and where, 
Until Thy blessed face I see,
Thy rest, Thy joy, Thy glory share.
 


375 ELLACOMBE

1. THE Son of God went forth to war,
A kingly crown to gain.
His blood-red banner streams afar;
Who follows in His train?
Who best can drink his cup of woe,
Triumphant over pain;
Who patient bears his cross below—
He follows in His train.

2. 'The martyr first, whose eagle eye
Could pierce beyond the grave; 
Who saw his Master in the sky,
And called on Him to save;
Like Him, with pardon on his tongue 
In midst of mortal pain,
He prayed for them that did the wrong; 
Who follows in his train?

3. A glorious band, the chosen few
On whom the Spirit came,
Twelve valiant saints, their hope they knew,
And bare the cross and flame.
They met the tyrant's brandished steel, 
The lion's gory mane,
They bowed their necks the death to feel; 
Who follows in their train?

4. A noble army, men and boys,
The matron and the maid,
Around the Saviour's throne rejoice,
In robes of white arrayed.
They climbed the steep ascent of heaven
Through peril, toil and pain; 
O God, to us may grace be given
To follow in their train. 



376 COVENANTERS

1. AM I a soldier of the cross, 
A follower of the Lamb,
And shall I fear to own His cause,
Or blush to speak His name?

2. Must I be carried to the skies
On flowery beds of ease,
While others fight to win the prize,
And sail through stormy seas?

3. Are there no foes for me to face?
Must I not stem the flood?
Is this vile world a friend to grace, 
To help me on to God?

4. Sure I must fight if I would win;
Increase my courage, Lord!
I'll bear the toil, endure the pain, 
Supported by Thy word.


377 GALILEE

1. JESUS calls us! O'er the tumult
Of our life's wild, restless sea,
Day by day His sweet voice soundeth,
Saying, "Christian, follow Me."

2. As of old apostles heard it
By the Galilean lake,
Turned from home and toil and kindred, 
Leaving all for His dear sake,
 
3. Jesus calls us from the worship
Of the vain world's golden store; 
From each idol that would keep us, 
Saying, "Christian, love Me more."

4. In our joys and in our sorrows,
Days of toil and hours of ease,
Still He calls, in cares and pleasures, 
"Christian, love Me more than these."

5. Jesus calls us! By Thy mercies,
Saviour, may we hear Thy call,
Give our hearts to Thine obedience,
Serve and love Thee best of all.


378 PATER OMNIUM

1. WE have not known Thee as we ought, 
Nor learned Thy wisdom, grace and power;
The things of earth have filled our thought, 
And trifles of the passing hour;
Lord, give us light Thy truth to see, 
And make us wise in knowing Thee.

2. We have not feared Thee as we ought,
Nor bowed beneath Thine aweful eye, 
Nor guarded deed and word and thought,
Remembering that God was nigh. 
Lord, give us faith to know Thee near, 
And grant the grace of holy fear.

3. We have not loved Thee as we ought,
Nor cared that we are loved by Thee; 
Thy presence we have coldly sought,
And feebly longed Thy face to see; 
Lord, give a pure and loving heart 
To feel and know the love Thou art.

4. We have not served Thee as we ought; 
Alas, the duties left undone,
The work with little fervour wrought,
The battles lost or scarcely won! 
Lord, give the zeal, and give the might, 
For Thee to toil, for Thee to fight.

5. When shall we know Thee as we ought,
And fear and love and serve aright? 
When shall we, out of trial brought,
Be perfect in the land of light?
Lord, may we day by day prepare
To see Thy face and serve Thee there.
 


379 ACCRINGTON

1. TAKE up thy cross, the Saviour said,
If thou wouldst My disciple be;
Take up thy cross, with willing heart,
And humbly follow after Me.

2. Take up thy cross; let not its weight
Fill thy weak soul with vain alarm; 
His strength shall bear thy spirit up,
And brace thy heart, and nerve thine arm.

3. Take up thy cross, nor heed the shame, 
Nor let thy foolish pride rebel;
The Lord for thee the cross endured
To save thy soul from death and hell.

4. Take up thy cross, and follow Christ, 
Nor think till death to lay it down; 
For only he who bears the cross
May hope to wear the glorious crown.
 


380 BLOCKLEY

1. O MASTER, let me walk with Thee 
In lowly paths of service free; 
Tell me Thy secret; help me bear 
The strain of toil, the fret of care.

2. Help me the slow of heart to move 
By some clear, winning word of love; 
Teach me the wayward feet to stay, 
And guide them in the homeward way.

3. Teach me Thy patience; still with Thee 
In closer, dearer company;
In work that keeps faith sweet and strong, 
In trust that triumphs over wrong;

4. In hope that sends a shining ray
Far down the future's broadening way;
In peace that only Thou canst give, 
With Thee, O Master, let me live.
 


381 ASPIRATION

1. MORE holiness give me, more strivings within;
More patience in suffering, more sorrow for sin; 
More faith in my Saviour, more sense of His care;
More joy in His service, more purpose in prayer.

2. More gratitude give me, more trust in the Lord; 
More zeal for His glory, more hope in His word; 
More tears for His sorrows, more pain at His grief; 
More meekness in trial, more praise for relief.

3. More purity give me, more strength to o'ercome;
More freedom from earthstains, more longings for home.
More fit for the kingdom, more used would I be, 
More blessed and holy; more, Saviour, like Thee.
 


382 CALON LAN

1. HEAVENLY Father, may Thy blessing 
Rest upon Thy children now,
When in praise Thy name we hallow, 
When in prayer to Thee we bow.
In the wondrous story reading
Of the Lord of truth and grace,
May we see Thy love reflected
In the light of His dear face. 

2. May we learn from this great story 
All the arts of friendliness,
Truthful speech and honest action, 
Courage, patience, steadfastness; 
How to master self and temper,
How to make our conduct fair;
When to speak and when be silent, 
When to do and when forbear.
 
3. May His Spirit, wise and holy,
With His gifts our spirits bless,
Make us loving, joyous, peaceful,
Rich in goodness, gentleness,
Strong in self-control, and faithful,
Kind in thought and deed; for He Sayeth, 
"What ye do for others Ye are doing unto Me."
 


383 RHODES

1. Sow in the morn thy seed,
At eve hold not thy hand;
To doubt and fear give thou no heed, 
Broadcast it o'er the land.

2. Thou know'st not which may thrive, 
The late or early sown;
Grace keeps the chosen germ alive,
When and wherever strewn.

3. And duly shall appear
In verdure, beauty, strength,
The tender blade, the stalk, the ear, 
And the full corn at length.

4. Thou canst not toil in vain; 
Cold, heat, and moist, and dry 
Shall foster and mature the grain 
For garners in the sky.


384 ST. MARGARET

1. O Love, that wilt not let me go,
I rest my weary soul in Thee;
I give Thee back the life I owe,
That in Thine ocean depths its flow 
May richer, fuller be.

2. O Light, that foll'west all my way,
I yield my flickering torch to Thee;
My heart restores its borrowed ray, 
That in Thy sunshine's blaze its day 
May brighter, fairer be.

3. O Joy, that seekest me through pain,
I cannot close my heart to Thee;
I trace the rainbow through the rain, 
And feel the promise is not vain 
That morn shall tearless be.


385 RACHIE

1. WHO is on the Lord's side? 
Who will serve the King?
Who will be His helpers, 
Other lives to bring?
Who will leave the world's side? 
Who will face the foe?
Who is on the Lord's side?
Who for Him will go?

By Thy great redemption,
By Thy grace divine,
We are on the Lord's side;
Saviour, we are Thine!

2. Not for weight of glory, 
Not for crown or palm, 
Enter we the army,
Raise the warrior's psalm; 
But for love that claimeth
Lives for whom He died—
He Christ Jesus nameth
Must be on His side!
 
3. Thou, O Lord, hast bought us,
Not with gold or gem,
But with Thine own life blood,
For Thy diadem.
With Thy blessing filling
All who come to Thee,
Thou hast made us willing,
Thou hast made us free.

4. Fierce may be the conflict,
Strong may be the foe, 
But the King's own army
None can overthrow; 
Round His standard ranging,
Victory is secure,
For His truth unchanging 
Makes the triumph sure.
386 RESOLUTION

1. HAVE ye counted the cost,
Ye warriors of the cross?
Are ye fixed in your heart for the Master's sake
To suffer all earthly loss?
Can ye bear the scoff of the worldly wise,
As ye pass by pleasure's bower,
To watch with the Lord on the mountain top
Through the dreary midnight hour? 

2. Ye may drink of His cup,
And in His baptism share.
Ye shall not fail, if ye tread in His steps,
His blood-stained cross to bear.
But count ye the cost, oh count ye the cost,
That ye be not unprepared;
And know ye the strength that alone can stand
In the conflict ye have dared.

3. In the power of His might,
Who was made through weakness strong
Ye shall overcome in the fearful fight 
And sing His victory song.
By the blood of the Lamb, by the blood of the Lamb,
By the faithful witness word,
Not loving your lives unto death for Him,
Ye shall triumph with your Lord.

4. Oh, the banner of love,
It will cost you a pang to hold.
But 'twill float in triumph the field above, 
Though your hearts' blood stain its fold.
Ye may count the cost, ye may count the cost
Of all of Egypt's gold,
But the riches of Christ ye cannot count,
 His love cannot be told.
 


387 DANIEL
 
1. STANDING by a purpose true,
Heeding God's command,
Honour them, the faithful few!
All hail to Daniel's band!

Dare to be a Daniel!
Dare to stand alone!
Dare to have a purpose firm!
Dare to make it known!

2. Many mighty men are lost,
Daring not to stand,
Who for God had been a host,
By joining Daniel's band.


388 ST. ETHELWALD

1. SOLDIERS of Christ, arise 
And put your armour on,
Strong in the strength which God supplies 
Through His eternal Son;

2. Strong in the Lord of hosts, 
And in His mighty power.
Who in the strength of Jesus trusts
Is more than conqueror.

3. Stand then in His great might, 
With all His strength endued;
And take, to arm you for the fight, 
The panoply of God.

4. Leave no unguarded place, 
No weakness of the soul;
Take every virtue, every grace,
And fortify the whole;

5. That having all things done,
And all your conflicts passed,
The victory won through Christ alone,
To dwell with Him at last.
 


389 CRUGER

1. BLEST Saviour, we would own Thee
Amid the world's proud scorn,
The world that mocked, and crowned Thee
With diadem of thorn.
The world that now rejects Thee,
Makes nothing of Thy love, Counts not the grace and pity
That brought Thee from above. 
 
2. O Lord, O Master, help us
To walk apart with Thee, 
Outside the camp, where only 
Thy beauty we may see;
Far from the world's loud turmoil, 
Far from its busy din,
Far from its praise and honour, 
Its unbelief and sin.

3. Oh, keep each heart at leisure
From all the world beside,
In close communion ever
Thus with Thee to abide;
So all Thy whispered breathings
Of love and truth to hear, 
And hail Thee with rejoicing
When Thou shalt soon appear.



390 MORNING LIGHT

1. STAND bravely for your Master,
Ye soldiers of the cross; Lift high His royal banner,
It must not suffer loss. From victory unto victory
His army will He lead,
Till every foe is vanquished,
And Christ is Lord indeed.

2. Stand bravely for your Master, 
The trumpet call obey,
Forth to the mighty conflict
In this most glorious day.
Ye that are men now serve Him
Against unnumbered foes;
Let courage rise with danger,
And strength to strength oppose.

3. Stand bravely for your Master,
Stand in His strength alone; 
The arm of flesh will fail you,
Ye dare not trust your own. 
Put on the gospel armour,
And, watching unto prayer, 
Where duty calls to danger
Be never wanting there.

4. Stand bravely for your Master,
The strife will not be long; 
This day the noise of battle,
The next the victor's song. 
To him that overcometh
A crown of life shall be;
He with the King of glory
Shall reign eternally.
 

391 PAULINA

1. WE'RE marching to Canaan with banner and song, 
We're soldiers enlisted to fight 'gainst the wrong; 
But lest in the conflict our strength should divide, 
We ask, "Who among us is on the Lord's side?"

Oh, who is there among us, the true and the tried, 
Who'll stand by his colours; who's on the Lord's side?

2. The sword may be burnished, the armour be bright 
(E'en Satan appears as an angel of light),
Yet darkly the bosom may treachery hide,
While lips are professing, "I'm on the Lord's side."

3. Oh, is one among us who cleaves not to God, 
Whose heart follows not in the path to be trod? 
Let him learn, ere the darkness his footsteps betide, 
That light, life and peace are upon the Lord's side.

4. Oh, heed not the sorrow, the pain or the wrong,
For soon shall our sighing be changed into song; 
So, bearing the cross of our covenant Guide,
We'll shout, as we triumph, "I'm on the Lord's side."
 


392 WATCHWORD

1. O CHRISTIAN, awake! for the strife is at hand; 
With helmet and shield, and a sword in thy hand, 
To meet the bold tempter, go, fearlessly go,
And stand, like the brave, with thy face to the foe.
Stand like the brave, With thy face to the foe!

2. The cause of thy Master with vigour defend, 
Be watchful, be zealous, and fight to the end; 
Wherever He leads thee, go, valiantly go.
And stand, like the brave, with thy face to the foe.

3. Press on, never doubting; thy Captain is near, 
With grace to supply and with comfort to cheer. 
His love, like a stream in the desert, will flow, 
Then stand, like the brave, with thy face to the foe.
 


393 VIGILATE

1. CHRISTIAN, seek not yet repose, 
Cast thy dreams of ease away; 
Thou art in the midst of foes 
"Watch and pray."

2. Principalities and powers, 
Mustering their unseen array, 
Wait for thine unguarded hours 
"Watch and pray."

3. Gird thy heavenly armour on, 
Wear it ever night and day; 
Ambushed lies the evil one 
"Watch and pray." 

4. Hear the victors who o'ercame; 
Still they mark each warrior's way; 
All with one clear voice exclaim 
"Watch and pray."

5. Hear, above all, hear thy Lord, 
Him thou lovest to obey;
Hide within thy heart His word¬
" Watch and pray."

6. Watch, as if on that alone
Hung the issue of the day;
Pray that help may be sent down 
"Watch and pray."
 


394 ST. ALPHEGE
 
1. BRIEF life is here our portion,
Brief sorrow, short-lived care; 
The life that knows no ending,
The tearless life is there.

2. Oh, happy retribution—
Short toil, eternal rest;
For cleansed and ransomed sinners 
A mansion with the blest.

3. For now we fight the battle,
But then shall wear the crown 
Of full and everlasting
And passionless renown.

4. And now we watch and struggle, 
And now we live in hope; 
And Zion in her anguish
With Babylon must cope. 

5. But He whom now we trust in,
Shall then be seen and known; 
And they that know and see Him
Shall have Him for their own.

6. The morning shall awaken,
The shadows pass away,
And each true-hearted servant
Shall shine as doth the day.

7. There God our blessed portion, 
In fulness of His grace,
We shall behold for ever
And worship face to face.

8. Then quickly come, Lord Jesus, 
And take Thy people home; 
We long for Thy returning,
Lord Jesus, quickly come! Amen.
 
Section 15. For Young Disciples
 
395 ST. OSWALD

1. JESUS Christ, my Lord and Saviour,
Once became a child like me; 
Oh, that in my whole behaviour
He my pattern still might be!

2. All my nature is unholy,
Pride and passion dwell within; 
But the Lord was meek and lowly, 
And was never known to sin.

3. While I'm often vainly trying
Some new pleasure to possess,
 He was always self-denying,
Patient in His worst distress.

4. Let me never be forgetful
Of His precepts any more, 
Idle, passionate, nor fretful,
As I've often been before.

5. Lord, though now Thou art in glory, 
I have Thine example still;
I can read Thy sacred story,
And obey Thy holy will.

6. Help me by that rule to measure
Every word and every thought, 
Thinking it my greatest pleasure,
There to learn what Thou hast taught.


396 CALM

1. GREAT God, and dost Thou condescend 
To be my Father and my Friend?
I, a poor child, and Thou so high, 
The Lord of earth and sea and sky!

2. Yes, wondrous God, for I received
Thy Son, and on His name believed. 
Now I'm a true-born child of Thine, 
And Thou, His Father, too art mine.

3. Thou art my Father; Thou canst bear 
To hear my poor imperfect prayer,
And Thou wilt listen to the praise 
That I, a little one, can raise.

4.Thou art my Father; let me be
A meek, obedient child to Thee,
And try, in word and deed and thought, 
To serve and please Thee as I ought.

5. Thou art my Father; I'll depend 
Upon the care of such a Friend,
And only wish to do and be 
Whatever seemeth good to Thee.

6. Then Thou, my Father, wilt at last, 
When all my days on earth are past, 
Receive me to my home above,
To rest for ever in Thy love.
 


397 IRBY
 
1. ONCE in royal David's city
Stood a lowly cattle shed,
Where a mother laid her Baby
In a manger for His bed;
Mary was that mother mild, Christ the Lord her little Child.

2. He came down to earth from heaven, 
Who is God and Lord of all;
And His shelter was a stable,
And His cradle was a stall;
With the poor and mean and lowly, 
Lived on earth our Saviour holy.

3. And through all His wondrous childhood, 
He would honour and obey,
Love and watch the lowly mother, 
In whose gentle arms He lay; 
Christian children all must be 
Mild, obedient, good like He.

4. For He is our childhood's pattern,
As we grow, He daily grew;
He was little, weak, and helpless, 
Tears and smiles like us He knew; 
And He feeleth for our sadness, 
And He shareth in our gladness.

5. And our eyes at last shall see Him, 
Through His own redeeming love;
For that Child, so meek and gentle, 
Is our Lord in heaven above; 
And He leads His people on
To the place where He is gone. 

6. Not in that poor lowly stable,
With the oxen standing by,
We shall see Him; but in heaven, 
Set at God's right hand on high;
When like stars His people crowned, 
All in white shall stand around.
398 ANGELS' STORY

1. I LOVE to hear the story
Which angel voices tell,
How once the King of glory
Came down on earth to dwell. 
I am both weak and sinful,
But this I surely know,
The Lord came down to save me, 
Because He loves me so.

2. I'm glad the blessed Saviour
Was once a child like me, 
To show how pure and holy
His little one should be. 
And I will try to follow
His footsteps here below; 
For He will ne'er forget me, 
Because He loves me so.

3. To sing His love and mercy,
My sweetest songs I'll raise; 
And though I cannot see Him,
I know He hears my praise;
 For He has kindly promised
That I shall surely go
To sing with Him in heaven,
Because He loves me so.
 


399 HE HIDETH MY SOUL

1. A WONDERFUL Saviour is Jesus my Lord, 
A wonderful Saviour to me;
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,
Where rivers of pleasure I see.

He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock, 
That shadows a dry, thirsty land;
He hideth my life in the depths of His love,
And covers me there with His hand.

2. A wonderful Saviour is Jesus my Lord, 
He taketh my burden away;
He holdeth me up and I shall not be moved; 
He giveth me strength as my day.

3. With numberless blessings each moment He crowns, 
And, filled with His goodness divine,
I sing in my rapture, Oh glory to God
For such a Redeemer as mine!

4. When, clothed in His brightness, transported I rise 
To meet Him in clouds of the sky,
His perfect salvation, His wonderful love,
I'll shout with the millions on high.
 


400 MOZART

1. WE saw Thee not when Thou didst tread, 
O Saviour, this our sinful earth;
Nor heard Thy voice restore the dead, 
And wake them to a second birth;
But we believe that Thou didst come, 
And quit for us Thy glorious home.

2. We were not with the faithful few
Who stood Thy bitter cross around,
Nor heard Thy prayer for those who slew, 
Nor felt the earthquake rock the ground. 
We saw no spear-wound pierce Thy side; 
Yet we believe that Thou hast died.

3. No angel's message met our ear
On that first glorious Lordly day,
"The Lord is risen, He is not here, 
Come see the place where Jesus lay;" 
But we believe that Thou didst quell 
The banded powers of death and hell.

4. We saw not Thee return on high.
And now, our longing sight to bless,
No rays of glory from the sky
Shine down upon our wilderness;
Yet we believe that Thou art there,
And seek Thee, Lord, in praise and prayer.

5. We heard Thee not when Thou didst say,
"I leave you now, but soon will come 
And take you from this world away
To dwell with Me in My bright home;
"But we believe Thou'It soon return;
To see Thee, Lord, our spirits yearn.


401 SAFFRON WALDEN

1. JUST as I am, Thine own to be, 
Friend of the young, who lovest me, 
To consecrate myself to Thee,
Lord Jesus Christ, I come. 

2. In the glad morning of my day, 
My life to give, my vows to pay, 
With no reserve and no delay,
With all my heart, I come.

3. I would live ever in the light,
I would work ever for the right,
I would serve Thee with all my might,
Therefore to Thee I come.

4. Just as I am, young, strong and free, 
To be the best that I can be
For truth and righteousness and Thee, 
Lord of my life, I come.


402 CARRADALE

1. I AM not skilled to understand
What God hath willed, what God hath planned;
I only know at His right hand 
Stands One who is my Saviour.

2. I take Him at His word indeed—
Christ died to save me, this I read; 
For in my heart I find a need
Of Him to be my Saviour.

3. That He should leave His place on high 
And come for sinful man to die—
You count it strange? So once did I, 
Before I knew my Saviour.

4. And oh, that He fulfilled may see 
The travail of His soul, in me; 
And with His work contented be,
 As I with my dear Saviour.

5. Yea, living, dying, let me bring
My strength, my solace from this spring—
That He who lives to be my King
Once died to be my Saviour.
 


403 JESUS, SAVIOUR PILOT ME

1. LIFE and light and joy are found
In the presence of the Lord;
Life, with richest blessings crowned, 
Light, from many fountains poured; 
Life and light and holy joy
None can darken or destroy.

2. Bring to Him life's brightest hours,
He will make them still more bright; 
Give to Him your noblest powers,
He will hallow all your might; 
Come to Him with eager quest, 
You shall hear His high behest.

3. All your questions large and deep,
All the open thoughts of youth,
Bring to Him, and you shall reap
All the harvest of His truth; 
You shall find in that great store 
Largest love and wisest lore.

4. Then, when come life's wider sphere 
And its busier enterprise,
You shall find Him ever near,
Looking with approving eyes 
On all honest work and true
That His servant's hands can do.

5. And if care should dim your eye,
And life's shadows come apace, 
You shall find Him ever nigh
In His all-abounding grace, 
Changing sorrow's darkest night
Into morning clear and bright. 


404 CHANNELS ONLY

1. How I praise Thee, precious Saviour,
That Thy love laid hold of me!
Thou hast saved and cleansed and filled me,
That I might Thy channel be.

Channels only, blessed Master,
But with all Thy wondrous power 
Flowing through us, Thou canst use us 
Every day and every hour.

2. Just a channel, full of blessing
To the thirsty hearts around; 
To tell out Thy full salvation,
All Thy loving message sound.

3. Emptied that Thou shouldest fill me,
A clean vessel in Thine hand;
With no power but as Thou givest
Graciously with each command.

4. Witnessing Thy power to save me,
Setting free from self and sin;
Thou hast bought me to possess me;
In Thy fulness, Lord, come in.

5. Jesus, fill now with Thy Spirit
Hearts that full surrender know; 
That the streams of living water
From our inner man may flow.
 


Section 16. The Place of the Name
 
405 HEREFORD

1. How truly lovely are Thy tents, 
O Lord of hosts, to me!
My longing soul faints for Thy courts, 
My heart cries out to Thee.
The sparrow and the swallow there
Find for their young a nest;
Thine altars, O my King and God,
Provide for them a rest.

2. Who in Thy house abide are blest, 
They will be praising still;
And blest is he who, trusting, loves 
The ways to Zion's hill.
Joy-springs and blessings mark their path 
Along this vale of tears;
With strength renewed before their God
 In Zion each appears.

3. Thine ear to my petitions, Lord,
Thou God of Jacob, yield.
Look now on Thine Anointed's face; 
Behold, O God, our shield.
A day that's spent within Thy courts 
A thousand ne'er excel;
I'd rather keep a door therein,
Than with the wicked dwell.

4. Himself to be a sun and shield,
The Lord, our God, doth show. 
Unstinted grace and glory, too,
He surely will bestow.
No good from them will He withhold,
Who walk now perfectly;
Yea, blessed is the man who trusts,
O Lord of hosts, in Thee. 



406 BETHANY

1. GOD is faithful, who forgave us
All the ills we e'er had done, 
And in pity deigned to save us
For the sake of His dear Son. 
God will through eternal ages
Not one sin remember more; 
Blotted from th'accusing pages,
Nought the writing can restore.

2. God is faithful, He has raised us
From the dust to glory high;
In His Christ secure has placed us,
Never more to fall and die.
Bonds of love thus forged in heaven,
Nothing, no one, can disrupt;
Wealth of heavenly blessings given
Rests where nothing can corrupt.

3. God is faithful, He whose word is 
Building up in unity
Saints who own His Christ their Lord is 
In the one Community.
These the Father ne'er forgetteth,
Who the Son thus honour here;
In His book their names He setteth,
Gems for Him to honour there.

4. God is faithful. Deem no burden 
He imposes hard to bear.
Faith beholds the blessed guerdon, 
Rest eternal waiting there.
Ye, who for the faith contending,
God-equipped are warring now, 
See the faithful God extending
Victor-wreaths to grace your brow.
 
5. God is faithful, He will ever
By His promises abide.
Human oaths may break, but never
Fails His word whate'er betide.
 All your fears His word relieving,
On, ye saints, your Lord to meet; 
Gladly then, your crowns receiving,
Haste to cast them at His feet.


407 ELIM

1. Lo! men deem fitting to adorn
The kingly Sufferer's brow,
Not with gemmed gold, but wreathen thorn, 
Then in derision bow.
With bitter taunt they haste the King,
Not to a glorious throne,
But to the cross the Lord they bring, 
And there His claims disown.

2. Now myriads own, above the skies,
His right divine to reign,
But still the guilty world denies 
His title with disdain.
Yet there's a place God set apart
Where He may reign on earth;
'Tis in the willing-opened heart
Of one of heavenly birth. 

3. That heart, which He so dearly bought, 
And cleansed by precious blood, 
The fount of every evil thought,
Once in rebellion stood.
Oh, wonder! that the Lord should choose 
This heart to be His throne,
Can I such honour e'er refuse,
Or spurn the grace He's shown?

4. Take, Lord, Thy rightful place within, 
And there supremely reign,
That never more oppressing sin 
Dominion may obtain.
Rule now 'midst subject hearts, O Lord, 
That so this sterile earth
May one green spot for Thee afford 
In all its scene of dearth.

5. Soon shall Thy feet in triumph stand 
Again on Olive's brow,
When men and kings of every land
At Thy great name shall bow. 
Meanwhile, O Lord, Thy sceptre wield
Among Thy loyal few,
Till, as in heaven, all earth shall yield 
To Thee Thy royal due.
 


408 KOCHER

1. THE high ways we have traversed,
And come to Zion's hill,
Where God, our God, is with us, 
His purpose to fulfil.

2. Here are God's house and altar,
The place of His great name, 
Where praise to Him ascendeth,
Where we His grace acclaim.

3.'Tis here a holy priesthood
Can look upon His face,
And hence a royal priesthood 
Proclaims His matchless grace.

4. This house for God to dwell in,
Of ransomed saints is built, 
Who by the great atonement
Are purged and free from guilt.

5. We come to Christ, the Chosen
(The living stone is He),
Through Him to God the Father, 
To make sweet melody.

6. And forth we'd go unfearing
The gospel to proclaim;
The Lord Himself is with us
As we exalt His name.

7. Earth's days will soon be over,
The day of Christ will come; 
Come quickly, Lord, to take us
To Thy bright heavenly home.


409 GOPSAL

1. JEHOVAH Elohim,
Thou Father and Thou Son
And Holy Spirit too
So perfectly are one.
Thy purposes and works agree 
In an eternal unity.

2. Thou Author of our lives, 
The counsels of Thy mind 
Decreed our union,
And Thou in one didst bind 
Our lives in Christ inseparable, 
A Body indivisible.

3. 'Tis precious too, O God, 
Thine eye should look upon 
Thy scattered children here 
United into one.
Lord, may Thy word for ever be 
Our guide to perfect unity.

4. Grant that more perfectly 
Thy will may be expressed,
That gathered saints may show 
Thy way of truth is best.
So mid this discord men may see 
Divinely ordered unity.

5. Light and discernment give
 Those who are unaware 
Dark error binds their feet 
In Satan's subtle snare;
Unfold Thy way of unity,
Show them the one Community.

6. All heaven shall soon rejoice
(Oh, haste the blissful day),
When Thou shalt call Thine own 
From every land away,
And those now sundered then shall be 
United for eternity.


410 ELLACOMBE

1. How perfect our salvation
Through Him who bore the shame. 
We're free from condemnation;
Sin offering He became. 
We are a holy nation,
And come in His blest name 
To offer our oblation,
To celebrate His fame.

2. Each Lordly morn confessing
The One who bore our blame, 
Such wealth in Him possessing,
His matchless worth acclaim. 
Yet week-day griefs oppressing,
With many a weary care,
Oft trials so hard, distressing,
Near drive us to despair.

3. But aye let us endeavour
To go to God in prayer, 
For sure no trial can sever
Our spirits from His care. 
Our hardest path is never
So hard as that He trod, 
Who day by day is ever
Just leading us to God.

4. Then sing we our salvation
As patiently we plod,
Resisting all temptation,
Nor fainting 'neath the rod.
With peaceful preparation 
For gospel message shod,
We'll seek Christ's approbation,
And tread the path he trod.


411 HULL

1. FROM various cares my heart retires;
Though deep and boundless its desires,
I've now to please but One;
Him to whom every knee shall bow, 
With Him is all my business now,
And those that are His own.

2. With these my happy lot is cast,
Through the world's deserts rude and waste
Or through its gardens fair; 
Whether the storms of trouble sweep, 
Or all in dead supineness sleep,
T' advance be all my care.

3. O Lord, my way, my truth, my life, 
Henceforth let sorrow, doubt and strife
Drop off like autumn leaves. 
Henceforth, as privileged by Thee, 
Simple and undistracted be
My soul, which to Thee cleaves.

4. Let me my feebleness recline
On that eternal love of Thine,
And human thoughts forget;
Childlike attend what Thou wilt say,
Go forth and serve Thee while 'tis day,
Nor leave my sweet retreat.
 


412 ROSSINI

1. As pants the hart for cooling streams
When heated in the chase,
So longs my soul, O God, for Thee
And Thy refreshing grace.

2. For Thee, my God, the living God,
My thirsty soul doth pine;
Oh, when shall I behold Thy face,
Thou Majesty divine?

3. Why restless, why cast down, my soul?
Hope still, and thou shalt sing 
The praise of Him who is thy God,
Thy health's eternal spring.

4. Oh, send Thy light and send Thy truth, 
And let them guide me still
To Zion's mount where Thou dost dwell, 
Yea, to Thy holy hill.

5. Unto the altar of my God,
To God my joy supreme,
I would draw nigh through precious blood, 
Where I may worship Him.


413 MONTGOMERY

1. How pleasant, how divinely fair,
O Lord of hosts, Thy dwellings are! 
With long desire my spirit faints
To join th' assemblies of Thy saints.

2. My flesh would rest in Thine abode, 
My panting heart cries out for God;
My God, my King, why should I be 
So far from all my joys and Thee?

3. The sparrow chooses where to rest, 
And for her young provides her nest; 
But will my God to sparrows grant 
That pleasure, and let His saints want?

4. Blest are the saints that find a place 
Within the temple of Thy grace; 
There they behold Thy gracious rays, 
And seek Thy face and learn Thy praise.

5. Yea, blest are they whose hearts are set 
To find the way to Zion's gate;
God is their strength, and on the road 
They lean upon their Helper, God.

6. Cheerful they walk with growing strength, 
Till all shall meet in heaven at length; 
There, never more to weep or fear, 
Before Thy face shall each appear.
 


414 RIVAULX

1. THIS is the day the Lord has made, 
In it He has His grace displayed. 
'Tis ours to sing in holy lays,
For all His love, our grateful praise.

2. O Lord, for all the days gone by, 
Thy name we gladly magnify;
For Thou hast brought us to Thine hill, 
Thy purpose, Lord, here to fulfil.

3. Within Thy house, in number few, 
We seek Thy grace Thy will to do. 
Lord, of ourselves we're very weak; 
Thy help and strength we humbly seek.

4. The future, Lord, we do not know, 
But seek that we in grace may grow, 
To meet what comes in simple faith, 
Believing what the Scripture saith.

5. For those who in Jehovah trust, 
Triumph they will and triumph must. 
Lord God Almighty, Thou our rock, 
Wilt surely save Thy little flock.

6. Oh, quickly send the coming day
When we shall leave these clods of clay; 
With those in Christ raised from the dead, 
We'll join with joy our glorious Head.
 


Section 17. The Lord's Future Purposes

415 PEMBROKE

1. HE sits exalted on the throne,
To us as mighty Saviour known, 
Our one and only Lord;
He waits with keen, expectant gaze, 
The coming of that day of days, 
The day of His reward!

2. Without delay He then shall rise,
And loud, triumphant through the skies
His gladsome shout will sound; 
Archangel voice and trump of God 
Shall waken saints beneath the sod,
The spacious world around.

3. In bodies incorrupt shall stand,
In this and many another land,
Those who in Christ have died; 
We too, who then alive remain, 
Shall see an end of all our pain,
Immortal, glorified. 

4. The Master's mighty, quickening voice 
Will make our every heart rejoice, 
And then His face we'll see;
'Twas once for us all bruised and marred,
 His brow with cruel thorn was scarred;
They nailed Him to the tree!

5. But then His face in glory bright 
Shall fill our wondering, ravished sight, 
And we like Him shall be.
Like Him in all those lovely traits, 
Which in His lowly, earthly days 
So beautiful we see.

6. Before the holy judgment throne 
We'll see, as we in awe bow down, 
Our works in fire be tried.
In view of that devouring flame,
Be this our prayer, and this our aim—
"In Him may we abide."



416 DENNIS

1. THE Lord Himself shall come
And shout the quickening word; 
Thousands shall answer from the tomb, 
"For ever with the Lord."

2. Then  as we upward fly,
That resurrection word
Shall be the shout of victory¬
“For ever with the Lord.”

3. How shall I meet those eyes?
Mine on Himself I'll cast,
And own myself the Saviour's prize; 
Mercy from first to last.

4. Knowing as I am known, 
How shall I love that word,
How oft repeat before the throne, 
"For ever with the Lord!"

5. That resurrection word,
That shout of victory,
Once more, "For ever with the Lord," 
Amen, so let it be!


417 ARIZONA

1. GREAT God, who, hid from mortal sight, 
Dost dwell in unapproached light, 
Before whose presence angels bow,
With faces veiled, in homage low;

2. Awhile in darkness we remain,
And round us yet are sin and pain; 
But soon the everlasting day
Shall chase our shades of night away.

3. For Thou hast promised, gracious Lord, 
A day of gladness and reward,
A day but faintly imaged here
By brightest sun at noontide clear.

4. When Christ shall come to set us free, 
He'll bring us in, O God, to Thee;
To see Thee, love Thee and adore, 
Our blissful task for evermore.

5. While here below our hearts prepare 
The fulness of Thy joy to share, 
Life's transient light may we improve. 
Till Christ shall take us up above.
 


418 MONTGOMERY

1. FOR ever with the Lord,
Amen, so let it be;
Life from the dead is in that word;
'Tis immortality.
Here in the body pent,
Absent from Him we roam, 
Yet nightly pitch our moving tent
A day's march nearer home.

2. Our Father's house on high,
Home of the soul how dear!
At times, to faith's far-seeing eye,
The golden gates appear.
Each thirsty spirit faints
To reach the home we love, 
The bright inheritance of saints, 
Jerusalem above.

3. And though there intervene
Rough roads and stormy skies, 
Faith will not suffer aught to screen 
The glory from our eyes.
There shall all clouds depart,
The wilderness shall cease;
And sweetly shall each gladdened heart 
Enjoy eternal peace.

4. Knowing as we are known,
How shall we love that word,
How oft repeat before the throne, 
"For ever with the Lord!" 
Here in the body pent,
Absent from Him we roam, 
Yet nightly pitch our moving tent 
A day's march nearer home.


419 HARK! HARK!

1. HARK! hark! hear the glad tidings,
Soon, soon will the Lord come, 
Robed, robed in honour and glory, 
To gather His ransomed ones home;
Yes, yes, oh yes!
To gather His ransomed ones home.

2. Joy! joy! sound it more loudly,
Sing, sing glory to God; 
Soon, soon is the Lord coming; 
Publish the tidings abroad.
Yes, yes, oh yes!
Publish the tidings abroad.

3. Now, now through a glass darkly
Shine, shine visions to come; 
Soon, soon we shall behold Him 
Cloudless and bright in our home;
Yes, yes, oh yes!
Cloudless and bright in our home.

4. Long, long have we been waiting, 
Who, who love His blest name;
 Now, now we are delighting,
The Lord's drawing near to proclaim. 
Yes, yes, oh yes!
The Lord's drawing near to proclaim.

5. Still, still rest on His promise,
Cling, cling fast to His word, 
Wait, wait, He will not tarry, 
We'll patiently wait for the Lord.
Yes, yes, oh yes!
We'll patiently wait for the Lord.
 


420 COMING

1. JESUS is coming! oh, sing the glad word, 
Coming for those He redeemed by His blood,
Coming to reign as the glorified Lord,
Jesus is coming again!
Jesus is coming again!
Shout the glad tidings o'er mountain and plain,
Jesus is coming again!

2. Jesus is coming! the dead shall arise, 
Loved ones shall meet in a joyful surprise, 
Caught up together to Him in the skies;
Jesus is coming again!

3. Jesus is coming, His saints to release, 
Coming to give to the warring earth peace; 
Sinning and sighing and sorrow shall cease.
Jesus is coming again!

4. Jesus is coming! the promise is true;
Who are the chosen, the faithful, the few, 
Waiting and watching, prepared for review? 
Jesus is coming again!


421 HAMPSHIRE (TROCHAIC)
 
1. OUR Lord's coming draweth nigh,
His long-sought unveiling;
Let us Maranatha cry
With a faith unfailing.
At the moment of His choice,
God's great might displaying, He will make His saints rejoice;
Christ is not delaying. 

2. From the realms of perfect day
Nought shall ever take us;
God shall wipe all tears away,
And will not forsake us.
But of all the wealth of bliss
Which Christ's poorness brought us, 
We shall treasure none like this-
'Twas Himself that bought us.
 
3. Blessedness of home at last,
There to be for ever;
Blessedness of sorrows past, 
Past all stern endeavour.
For such blessedness prepare 
What our Master loveth 
Gold and gems and treasure rare; 
All our work He proveth.	

4. Life's last thread may soon be spun, 
Fleeting tasks be ended;
This our web of service done,
Our days here expended;
But within the courts above,
With abiding pleasure,
We shall serve Him whom we love, 
Without stint or measure.
	
5. Gathering cloud and threat of sea
Home the traveller urges; 
We would to the haven flee,
Where storm no more surges. 
In our hearts the breaking dawn
Hope anew awakens,
And the day-star with the morn 
Entrance sure betokens.


422 HOLD THE FORT

1. Ho, my comrades, see the signal
Waving in the sky!
See the glorious banner waving!
Victory is nigh!	

"Hold the fort, for I am coming!" 
Jesus signals still:
Wave the answer back to heaven,
"By Thy grace we will!"

2.Reinforcements now appearing
Hear the trumpet blow!
In our Leader's name we'll triumph
Over every foe!

3. See the mighty host advancing,	
Satan leading on;	
Fierce and long the battle rages,
But our help is near;

4. Mighty men around us falling,	
Courage almost gone!	
Onward comes our great Commander,
Cheer, my comrades, cheer!
 


423 WILDERSMOUTH

1. BLESSED Lord, our souls are longing
Thee, our risen Head, to see;
And the cloudless morn is dawning 
Thy saints shall gathered be. 
Grace and glory!
All our well-springs are in Thee.

2. All the sorrow we are tasting, 
Is but as the dream of night;
To the day of Christ we're hasting, 
Looking for it with delight.
Thou art coming; 
This will satisfy our sight.

3. True, the silent grave is keeping
Many a seed in weakness sown,
But the saints in Thee now sleeping,
Raised in power shall share Thy throne.
Resurrection!
Lord of glory, 'tis Thine own.

4. As we sing, our hearts grow lighter, 
We are children of the day;
Sorrow makes our hope the brighter,
Faith regards not the delay.
Sure the promise,
We shall meet Thee on the way.
 


424 ME TA RASSESTHO

1. "LET not your heart be troubled, 
Nor let it be afraid;
Believe in God, My Father, 
Believe what I have said.
My Father's house hath many 
A mansion bright and fair; 
And I am going yonder
A place now to prepare.

2."A place for you I'll furnish
Where you shall ever be;
I'll come again and take you
To dwell for aye with Me.
 I'm going to the Father
Who will send you a Guide, 
The blessed holy Paraclete, 
Within you to abide."

3. We look, then, for His coming. 
We who alive remain,
And they who sleep, together
Shall see the Lamb once slain. 
They raised in incorruption,
And we from death set free, 
Shall all be like the Master,
Oh mighty mystery!

4. We wait for Christ, the Saviour, 
To come from heaven above, 
To fashion us in glory,
And teach us all His love.
He says, "I'm coming quickly," 
We cry with one accord
To Christ, our great Redeemer, 
"Come quickly, blessed Lord."

1. A LITTLE while, our Lord shall come, 
And we shall wander here no more; 
He'll take us to His Father's home, 
Where He for us has gone before; 
To dwell with Him, to see His face, 
And sing the glories of His grace.

2. A little while, He'll come again. 
Let us the precious hours redeem; 
Our only grief to give Him pain, 
Our joy to serve and follow Him; 
Oh, may we watch and ready be, 
As those who long their Lord to see.

3. A little while, 'twill soon be past!
Why should we shun the shame and cross? 
Oh, let us in His footsteps haste,
And count for Him all else but loss; 
Oh, how will recompense His smile 
The sufferings of this little while!

4. A little while! Come, Saviour, come;
For Thee Thy Bride has tarried long. 
Take Thy poor waiting pilgrims home, 
To sing the new eternal song;
To see Thy glory, and to be
In everything conformed to Thee.


426 WATERSTOCK

1. HE comes, Immanu El,
Who once was crucified,
The Man of Sorrows He,
Who bowed His head and died; 
He hath redeemed us by His blood, 
He comes to take us home to God.

2. He comes, our Advocate,
Who bears us on His breast, 
Himself to take us home
To His eternal rest.
Oh, let this hope dispel each fear,
Our great High Priest will soon appear.

3. He comes, our Shepherd comes 
Whose eyelids never sleep,
To gather in the skies
The myriads of His sheep. 
Where the eternal fountains spring 
Of love divine, His flock He'll bring.

4. He comes, the Heir of all;
All shall His power obey.
The Bridegroom to His Church 
His glories shall display.
But oh, His love what tongue can tell, 
Eternal, vast, unsearchable!

5."Behold, I quickly come."
 Responsive to this word 
The Spirit and the Bride Cry, 
"Even so, O Lord;
Nought else can satisfy her heart,
But to be with Thee where Thou art."



427 CALVARY

1. SWEET that word of Thine, Lord Jesus,
"I the resurrection am;"
From among the dead it frees us,
We believing in Thy name.
Holy Saviour,
Let us now Thy love proclaim.

2. Should we die, then resurrection,
Then the glorious mystery;
Raised to know a long perfection,
In Thy likeness we shall be.
In a moment
Raised to incorruption we.

3. We who live, on earth remaining
Till Thy coming, ne'er shall die, 
Never need a resurrection,
Changed and gathered in the sky; 
In a moment
Made immortal,
In the twinkling of an eye.

4. Thus in living or in dying
We have here a wondrous word; 
On that faithful word relying,
We are happy in the Lord;
For in living
Or in dying,
Life and joy it doth afford.


5. Grieve we not for loved ones sleeping,
For they soon will rise again;
Better look for days of greeting,
Days of resurrection gain.
Blissful greetings
Wait us mid that glittering train.

6. Oh what songs of Hallelujah
Then will burst with glad accord!
Loud triumphant songs ascending, 
Giving glory to the Lord;
Songs ascending
Never ending,
Harpers harping with each word.

7. Mid the promised incorruption,
Mid the glorious mystery,
Death and sin in long destruction 
Swallowed up in victory;
In the image
Of the heavenly we shall be.

8. Hallelujah, hallelujah, 
Hallelujah, mid the skies;
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
From our ransomed tongues shall rise;
Oh what glory
To have gained our long-loved prize!
 


428 CHRIST RETURNETH 

1. IT may be at morn, when the day is awaking,
When sunlight through darkness and shadow is breaking,
Christ Jesus will come in the fulness of glory, 
To take from the world His own.

O Lord Jesus, how long ere we shout the glad song? 
"Christ returneth! Hallelujah!
Hallelujah! Amen! "
 
2. It may be at midday, it may be at twilight,
It may be, perchance, that the blackness of midnight 
Will burst into light in the blaze of His glory,
When Christ shall return for His own.

3. Oh joy, oh delight, should we go without dying! 
No sickness, no sadness, no dread and no crying, 
Caught up through the clouds with our Lord into glory,
When Christ shall return for His own!
 


429 LYNNWOOD

1. OH, what a lonely path were ours,
Could we, O Father, see
No home nor rest beyond it all,
No guide nor help in Thee.

2. But Thou art near and with us still, 
To keep us on the way
That leads along this vale of tears
To the bright world of day.

3.There shall Thy glory, O our God,
Break fully on our view;
And we, Thy saints, rejoice to prove
That all Thy word was true.

4. There Jesus, on the heavenly throne,
Our wondering eyes shall see; 
While we the blest associates there
Of all His joy shall be.

5. Sweet hope! we leave without a sigh
A blighted world like this,
To bear the cross, despise the shame,
For all that weight of bliss.

6. Yet little do Thy saints at best
Endure, O Lord, for Thee,
Whose suffering soul bore all our sins 
And sorrows on the tree;
 
7. Who faced our fierce, our ruthless foe, 
Unaided and alone,
To win or us Thy crown of joy,
To raise us to Thy throne.
 


430 BEATITUDO
 
1. MY soul, amid this stormy world,
Is like some fluttered dove;
And fain would be as swift of wing, 
To fly to Him I love..

2. The cords that bound my heart to earth
Were broken by His hand;
Before His cross I now am left
A stranger in the land.

3. That visage marred, those sorrows deep,
The thorns, the scourge, the gall; 
These were the golden chains of love,
His captives to enthral.

4. My heart is with Him on the throne, 
And ill can brook delay,
Each moment listening for the voice,
"Rise up and come away."

5. With hope deferred, oft sick and faint,
"Why tarries He?" I cry,
And should my Saviour chide my haste,
Sure I could make reply 

6. "May not an exile, Lord, desire
His own sweet land to see? 
May not a captive seek release,
A prisoner to be free?

7. "A child when far away may long
For home and kindred dear;
And she that waits her absent Lord
May sigh till He appear.

8. "I would, my Lord and Saviour, know
That which no measure knows;
Would search the mystery of Thy love,
The depth of all Thy woes.

9. "I fain would strike my golden harp
Before the Father's throne;
There cast my crown of righteousness,
And sing what grace has done.

10. "Then leave me not in this dark world, 
A stranger long to roam;
Come, Lord, and take me to Thyself,
Lord Jesus, quickly come."
 


431 MOOR WOOD

1. MIDST the darkness, storm and sorrow, 
One bright gleam I see—
Well I know the blessed morrow,
Christ will come for me.
Midst the light and peace and glory 
Of the Father's home,
Christ for me is watching, waiting, 
Waiting till I come.

2. Long the blessed Guide has led me 
By the desert road;
Now I see the golden towers,
City of my God;
There amidst the love and glory, 
He is waiting yet;
On His hands a name is graven,
He can ne'er forget.

3. There amidst the songs of heaven, 
Sweeter to His ear
Is the footfall through the desert, 
Ever drawing near.
There made ready are the mansions,
Glorious, bright and fair,
But the Bride the Father gave Him 
Still is wanting there.

4. Who is This who comes to meet me 
On the desert way,
As the morning star foretelling
God's unclouded day?
He it is who came to save me,
On the cross of shame;
In His glory well I know Him,
Evermore the same.

5. Oh, the blessed joy of meeting,
All the desert past!
Oh, the wondrous words of greeting
He shall speak at last! 
He and I together entering
Those bright courts above; 
He and I together sharing
All the Father's love!

6. Where no shade nor stain can enter,
Nor the gold be dim; 
In that holiness unsullied,
I shall walk with Him;
Meet companion for the Master,
From Him, for Him made; 
Glory of God's grace for ever,
There in me displayed!
 
7. He, who in the hour of sorrow
Bare the cross alone;
I, who through the lonely desert
Trod where He had gone; 
He and I in that bright glory
One deep joy shall share—
Mine to be for ever with Him,
His that I am there. 


432 DAWNING

1. I AM waiting for the dawning 
Of the bright and blessed day,
When this darksome night of sorrow
Shall have vanished far away;
When for ever with the Saviour, 
Far beyond this vale of tears,
I shall swell the song of worship 
Through the everlasting years.

2. I am looking for the brightness
(See it shineth from afar)
Of the clear and joyous beaming 
Of the bright and morning Star.
Through the dark grey mist of morning 
Do I see its glorious light;
Then away with every shadow 
Of this sad and weary night.

3. I am waiting for the coming
Of the Lord, who died for me;
Oh, His words have thrilled my spirit,
"I will come again for thee!"
I can almost hear His footfall
On the threshold of the door,
And my heart, my heart is longing 
To be with Him evermore.
 


433 RAYNOLDS

1. SWEET is the hope of glorious resurrection,
But sweeter still that promise, Lord, from Thee, 
Breathing the longings of Thy deep affection,
"I come to take you with Myself to be."

2. Blest words to those through pain and sorrow wading, 
" 'Tis to My Father's house I needs must go,
There to prepare a place where joy unfading
In Mine own presence ye may ever know."

3. Hope in bereavement His assurance giveth,
Lifting dark clouds of sorrow from the heart. 
Soon will the advent of the One who liveth,
Loved ones in Christ unite, no more to part.

4. Shine too, O Hope, in purifying splendour!
Illume my soul amid earth's squalid night;
Cleanse from defilement service I would render,
That unashamed I hail Thy presence bright.

5. Grant, Lord, no other hope my heart engages,
Earth's fleeting dreams ne'er grow to me more dear; 
That never faintly, as from distant ages,
Shall fall that promise on my listless ear.

6. E'er may the hope of Thy return be calling
With trumpet note to work, to watch, to pray;
Soon work must cease; for, see, the night is falling;
Haste to the labour while 'tis called today.

7. May each swift hour, Lord, tell me 
Thou art nearer, Nearer to me 
Thy presence is, and home;
Moment by moment may Thy voice sound clearer,
" Quickly I come." Amen! Lord Jesus, come!
 


434 SHARON
 
1. ARE we watching for the Master?
For His coming draweth near; 
Are we ready for the moment
When He shall for us appear?

2. Are we watching for the Master?
If He should return today,
Would He come and find us sleeping 
As the moments pass away?

3. Are we waiting for the Master?
Does our light so brightly burn 
That it shows to all around us
We await our Lord's return?

4. Are we waiting for the Master,
Occupying till He come,
Seeking in some little measure,
If so be we may win some?

5. Are we watching, waiting, praying,
Listening daily to His voice,
And obeying His commandments?
Do we make His heart rejoice?

6. Are we praying that the Master,
When He comes to claim His own, 
May some precious fruit then gather
From the seed that we have sown?

7. Soon the watching will be over,
And the waiting time be past, 
Earthly praying will be ended;
We shall meet our Lord at last.

8. And when in His holy presence
We again our works shall meet, 
Will they stand the fiery testing
At the coming judgment seat?

435 DEEP HARMONY

1. WE wait the coming of our Lord,
Nor shall this blessed hope prove vain; 
He cannot break His faithful word, 
That says He'll surely come again.

2. Come, then, Lord Jesus, quickly take 
Thy people to their heavenly home; 
Awhile they suffer for Thy sake,
But sweet their hope of joys to come. 

3. We long to see Thee as Thou art,
We long to mount with Thee above;
With all Thy saints to bear our part, 
And sing Thine everlasting love.

4. Meanwhile we glory in Thy cross,
As Thou wast, Lord, we fain would be; 
All earthly gain we'd count but loss, 
And joy to share reproach with Thee.
 


436 LLANFAIR
 
1. CHRIST the Lord will come again, Hallelujah!
Not to suffer woe or pain, Hallelujah! 
But in majesty to reign, Hallelujah!

2. Christ will come into the air, Hallelujah!
Changed or raised we'll meet Him there, Hallelujah!
Evermore His image bear, Hallelujah!

3. Christ will come to Israel's land, Hallelujah!
He on Olive's mount will stand, Hallelujah! 
With His overcoming band, Hallelujah!

4. Christ shall reign the wide world o'er, Hallelujah! 
Vice shall lift its head no more, Hallelujah!
Peace shall spread from shore to shore, Hallelujah!

5. Seated on the great white throne, Hallelujah! 
Him as Lord, and Lord alone, Hallelujah! 
All mankind shall fully own, Hallelujah!

6. We by whom Thou'rt now adored, Hallelujah!
Cry to Thee with one accord, Hallelujah! 
Quickly come, Christ Jesus, Lord, Hallelujah!
 


437 AUSTRIA

1. GLORIOUS things of thee are spoken,
Heavenly city of our God;
He, whose word can ne'er be broken,
Formed thee for His own abode. 
On the rock of ages founded,
What can shake thy sure repose? 
With salvation's walls surrounded,
Thou mayest smile at all thy foes.

2. See the streams of living waters,
Springing from eternal love,
Flow to cheer thy sons and daughters,
And all fear of want remove.
Who can faint where such a river
Freely flows their thirst t'assuage, 
Blessings which, like God the Giver,
Never fail from age to age?

3. Round each habitation hovering, 
See the cloud and fire appear 
For a glory and a covering,
Showing that the Lord is there.
He who gives the daily manna,
He who listens to their cry,
Let Him hear the loud Hosanna 
Rising to His throne on high.

4. Let the world deride or pity,
We may well endure the shame, 
Since, O Lord, in that blest city 
Thou hast record of our name. 
Fading is the sinner's pleasure,
All his boasted pomp and show. 
Solid joy and lasting treasure
None but God's own children know.


438 IMMANUEL

1. BRIDE of the Lamb, awake! awake!
Why sleep for sorrow now?
The hope of glory, Christ is Thine,
An heir of glory thou.

2. Thy spirit through the lonely night, 
From earthly joy apart,
Has sighed for One who's far away,
The Bridegroom of thy heart.

3. But now the night is waning fast,
The breaking morn is near, 
The Bridegroom comes with voice of love
The drooping heart to cheer.

4. He comes; for oh, His yearning heart 
No more can bear delay;
To scenes of full unmingled joy
To call His Bride away.

5. This earth, the scene of all His woe,
A homeless wild to thee,
Full soon upon His heavenly throne
Its rightful King shall see.

6. Thou too shalt reign; 
He will not wear His crown of joy alone;
And earth His royal Bride shall see
Beside Him on the throne.

7. Then weep no more, 'tis all thine own,
His crown, His joy divine;
And sweeter far than all beside
He, He Himself is thine.
 


439 TILTEY ABBEY

1. GIVE me the wings of faith to rise
Within the veil, and see
The saints above, how great their joys,
How bright their glories be.

2. Once they were mourners here below,
And wet their couch with tears; 
They wrestled hard, as we do now,
With sins and doubts and fears.

3. I ask them whence their victory came; 
They, with united breath,
Ascribe their conquest to the Lamb,
Their triumph to His death.

4. They marked the footsteps that He trod,
His zeal inspired their breast;
Like Him they walked the way of God.
And gained the promised rest.

5. Our glorious Leader claims our praise
For His own pattern given;
While the long cloud of witnesses 
Show the same path to heaven.


440 VISION

1. FACE to face with Christ my Saviour! 
Face to face, what will it be,
When with rapture I behold Him, 
Jesus Christ, who died for me?

Face to face shall I behold Him,
Far beyond the starry sky; 
Face to face in all His glory
I shall see Him by and by!

2. Only faintly now I see Him,
With the darkening veil between;
But a blessed day is coming 
When His glory shall be seen.

3. What rejoicing in His presence,
When are banished grief and pain,
When the crooked ways are straightened
And the dark things shall be plain!

4. Face to face! Oh, blissful moment,
Face to face, to see and know; 
Face to face with my Redeemer,
Jesus Christ, who loves me so!
 


441 SILVER CORD

1. SOME day the silver cord will break,
And I no more as now shall sing; 
But oh, the joy when I shall wake
Within the palace of the King!

And I shall see Him face to face, 
And tell the story—Saved by grace!

2. Some day my earthly house will fall,
I cannot tell how soon 'twill be; 
But this I know, my All-in-all
Has now a place in heaven for me.

3. Some day! Till then I'll watch and wait,
My lamp all trimmed and burning bright, 
That when my Saviour opes the gate,
My soul to Him may take its flight.


442 EUPHONY

1. WHAT will it be to dwell above,
And with the Lord of glory reign, 
Since the sweet earnest of His love 
So brightens all this dreary plain!
No heart can think, no tongue explain, 
What joy 'twill be with Christ to reign.

2. When sin no more obstructs our sight, 
When sorrow pains the heart no more; 
When we shall see the Prince of light, 
And all His works of grace explore; 
What heights and depths of love divine 
Will there through endless ages shine!

3. And God has fixed the happy day 
When the last tear shall dim our eyes; 
When He will wipe all tears away 
And fill our hearts with glad surprise, 
To hear His voice, to see His face, 
And know the riches of His grace.

4. This is the joy we seek to know,
For this with patience we would wait; 
Till, called from earth and all below, 
We rise, our gracious Lord to meet, 
His home for evermore to share,
And praise the love that brought us there.


443 NO NIGHT THERE

1. IN the land of fadeless day
Lies "the city four-square;"
 It shall never pass away,
And there is "no night there."

God shall wipe away all tears; 
There's no death or pain or fears; 
And they count not time by years, 
For there is "no night there."

2. All the gates of pearl are made
In" the city four-square;" 
All the street with gold is laid,
And there is "no night there."

3. And the gates shall never close
To "the city four-square;"
There life's crystal river flows,
And there is "no night there."

4. There they need no sunshine bright 
In "the city four-square; "
For the Lamb is all the light,
And there is "no night there."
 


444 CASTLE RISING

1. THE roseate hues of early dawn,
The brightness of the day,
The crimson of the sunset sky,
How fast they fade away!
Oh, for the pearly gates of heaven, 
Oh, for the golden floor,
Oh, for the Sun of righteousness, 
That setteth nevermore!

2. The highest hopes we cherish here,
How fast they tire and faint!
How many a spot defiles the robe
That wraps an earthly saint! 
Oh, for a heart that never sins,
For robes unsullied white;
Oh, for a voice to praise our Lord,
Nor weary day nor night!

3. Here faith is ours, and heavenly hope, 
And grace to lead us higher;
But there are perfectness and peace 
Beyond our best desire.
Oh, by Thy love and anguish, Lord, 
And by Thy life laid down,
Grant that we fail not Thee to please, 
Nor fail to win the crown!


445 GOLDEN SHORE

1. WE are out on the ocean sailing;
Homeward bound we swiftly glide. 
We are out on the ocean sailing
To a home beyond the tide.

All the storms will soon be over, 
Then we'll anchor in the harbour; 
We are out on the ocean sailing
To a home beyond the tide.

2. Millions now are safely landed
Over on the golden shore;
Many more are on their journey,
Yet there's room for millions more.

3. Spread your sails, while heavenly breezes 
Gently waft our vessel on;
All on board are sweetly singing,
Free salvation is our song.

4. When we all are safely landed,
We shall shout, our trials o'er; 
We shall walk about the city,
And we'll sing for evermore.
 


446 OVER YONDER

1. OH, to be over yonder,
In that bright land of wonder,
Where th' angel voices mingle and the angel harps do ring!
Set free from care and sorrow,
And th' anxious dread to-morrow,
To rest in light and sunshine in the presence of the King.

2. Oh, to be over yonder!
My longing heart grows fonder
Of resting on the faithful word, until the day-star bring
Glad tidings of th'awaking,
Of th' cloudless, pure day breaking;
My heart is yearning, yearning for the coming of the King.

3. Oh, to be over yonder! Alas, I sigh and ponder,
Why clings this poor weak heart of mine to any earthly thing? 
Each earthly tie must sever
And pass away for ever;
There's no more separation in the presence of the King.
 


447 ST. WINIFRED

1. IN the Christian's home in glory
There remains a land of rest,
Where the Saviour's gone before me 
To fulfil my soul's request.
He is fitting up my mansion, 
Which eternally shall stand;
For my stay will not be transient 
In that holy, happy land.

2. Pain or sickness ne'er can enter, 
Grief nor woe my lot shall share; 
But in that celestial centre
I a crown of life shall wear.
Death itself has now been vanquished,
And its sting has been withdrawn.
Shout with gladness, O ye ransomed,
Hail with joy the happy morn.

3. Sing, oh sing, ye heirs of glory!
Shout your triumphs as ye go! 
Zion's gates will open to you,
You shall find an entrance through. 
Hallelujah! Christ is coming;
He will take His people home.
Quickly come, Lord Jesus, Saviour;
Blessed Master, quickly come!
 


448 SWEET BY AND BY

1. THERE'S a land that is fairer than day, 
And by faith we can see it afar,
For the Saviour waits over the way, 
To prepare us a dwelling place there.

In the sweet by-and-by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.

2. We shall sing on that beautiful shore 
The melodious songs of the blest; 
And our spirits shall sorrow no more, 
Not a sigh for the blessing of rest.

3. To our bountiful Father above
We will offer the tribute of praise, 
For the glorious gift of His love,
And the blessings that hallow our days.
 


449 RUTHERFORD
 
1. THE sands of time are sinking,
The dawn of heaven breaks;
The summer morn I've sighed for,
The fair, sweet morn awakes;
Dark, dark hath been the midnight,
But dayspring is at hand; 
And glory, glory dwelleth
In Immanuel's land!

2. There the red Rose of Sharon
Unfolds its heartsome bloom, 
And fills the air of heaven
With ravishing perfume; 
Oh, to behold its blossom,
While by its fragrance fanned, 
While glory, glory dwelleth
In Immanuel's land!

3. The King there in His beauty,
Without a veil is seen;
It were a well-spent journey,
Though seven deaths lay between. 
The Lamb, with His fair army.
Doth on mount Zion stand, 
And glory, glory dwelleth
In Immanuel's land! 

4. Oh Christ, He is the fountain,
The deep, sweet well of love!
The streams on earth I've tasted,
More deep I'll drink above. 
There to an ocean fulness
His mercy doth expand, 
And glory, glory dwelleth
In Immanuel's land!

5. I've wrestled on toward heaven,
'Gainst storm and wind and tide; 
Now, like a weary traveller,
That leaneth on his guide, 
Amid the shades of evening,
While sinks life's lingering sand, 
I hail the glory dawning
From Immanuel's land.

6. Deep waters crossed life's pathway,
The hedge of thorns was sharp; 
Now these lie all behind me,
Oh, for a well-tuned harp! 
Oh, to join Hallelujah
With yon triumphant band, 
Who sing, where glory dwelleth, 
In Immanuel's land!
 
7. With mercy and with judgment
My web of time He wove, 
And aye the dews of sorrow
Were lustred with His love. 
I'll bless the hand that guided,
I'll bless the heart that planned,
When throned where glory dwelleth,
In Immanuel's land.

8. Soon shall the cup of glory
Wash down earth's bitterest woes; 
Soon shall the desert's brier
Break into Eden's rose;
The curse shall change to blessing, 
The name on earth that's banned 
Be graven on the white stone
In Immanuel's land.

9. Oh, I am my Beloved's,
And my Beloved's mine! 
He brings a poor vile sinner
Into His house of wine. 
I stand upon His merit,
I know no safer stand,
Not e'en where glory dwelleth,
In Immanuel's land.

10. The bride eyes not her garment,
But her dear Bridegroom's face. 
I will not gaze at glory,
But on my King of grace; 
Not at the crown He givett,
But on His pierced hand; 
The Lamb is all the glory
Of Immanuel's land. 


450 ROBES OF WHITENESS

1. OH, for the robes of whiteness!
Oh, for the tearless eyes!
Oh, for the glorious brightness
Of the unclouded skies!
Oh, for the no more weeping
Within the land of love; 
The endless joy of keeping
The bridal feast above!

2. Oh, for the bliss of rising,
My coming Lord to meet! 
Oh, for the rest of lying
For ever at His feet!
Oh, for the hour of seeing
My Saviour face to face; 
The hope of ever being
In that sweet resting-place!

3. Lord Jesus, King of glory,
I soon shall dwell with Thee. 
I soon shall sing the story
Of Thy great love to me. 
Meanwhile my thoughts would enter,
E'en now before Thy throne, 
That all my love might centre
On Thee, and Thee alone.
 


451 ST. MATTHEW

1. THERE is a fold whence none can stray,
And pastures ever green,
Where sultry sun or stormy sky
Or night are never seen. 
Far up the everlasting hills,
In God's own light it lies; 
His smile its vast dimension fills
With joy that never dies.

2. There is a Shepherd living there,
The First-born from the dead,
Who tends with sweet, unwearied care
The flock for which He bled.
There soon will meet the sons of light,
Fair as the morning sky,
And taste of infinite delight
Beneath the Saviour's eye.

3. There in the power of heavenly sight
We'll gaze upon the throne,
And scan perfection's utmost height,
And know as we are known.
Joy, bursting forth in strains of love
In one harmonious song,
Will through the heavenly courts above 
Roll echoing along.

4. Hope's rapturous scenes inspire our song 
While toiling here below;
And more and more our spirits long
Thy presence, Lord, to know! 
Oh, take us to that blissful shore
To sing that joyful strain,
And from our God go out no more, 
Nor ever weep again!


452 TO BE THERE

1. WE sing of the realms of the blest, 
That country so bright and so fair, 
And oft are its glories confessed; 
But what must it be to be there!

2. We speak of its freedom from sin, 
From sorrow, temptation and care, 
From trials without and within; 
But what must it be to be there!

3. We speak of its service of love,
Of the robes which the glorified wear, 
The church of the first-born above; 
But what must it be to be there!

4. Do Thou, Lord, midst pleasure and woe, 
Still for heaven our spirits prepare;
And shortly we also shall know,
And feel, what it is to be there.


453 ALETTA

1. WHEN this passing world is done, 
When has sunk yon radiant sun; 
When I stand with Christ in glory, 
Looking o'er life's finished story; 
Then, Lord, shall I fully know, 
Not till then, how much I owe.
 
2. When I stand before the throne 
Dressed in beauty not my own; 
When I see Thee as Thou art, 
Love Thee with unsinning heart; 
Then, Lord, shall I fully know, 
Not till then, how much I owe.

3. When the praise of heaven I hear, 
Loud as thunders to the ear, 
Loud as many waters' noise, 
Sweet as harp's melodious voice; 
Then, Lord, shall I fully know, 
Not till then, how much I owe.

4. E'en on earth, as through a glass 
Darkly, let Thy glory pass; 
Make forgiveness feel so sweet, 
Make Thy Spirit's help so meet;
E'en on earth, Lord, make me know 
Something of how much I owe.

5. Chosen not for good in me,
Wakened up from wrath to flee; 
Hidden in the Saviour's side,
By the Spirit sanctified;
Teach me, Lord, on earth to show 
By my love, how much I owe.


454 ABRIDGE

1. How bright those glorious spirits shine!
Whence all their white array? 
How came they to the blissful seats
Of everlasting day?

2. Lo, these are they from suffering great,
Who came to realms of light,
And in the blood of Christ have washed
Those robes which shine so bright.

3. Now with triumphal palms they stand
Before the throne on high,
And serve the God they love, amidst 
The glories of the sky.

4. Hunger and thirst are felt no more,
Nor sun with scorching ray;
God is their sun, whose cheering beams
Diffuse eternal day.

5. The Lamb who reigns upon the throne
Shall o'er them still preside,
Feed them with nourishment divine,
And all their footsteps guide.

6. Mid pastures green He'll lead His flock,
Where living streams appear; 
And God the Lord from every eye
Shall wipe off every tear.
