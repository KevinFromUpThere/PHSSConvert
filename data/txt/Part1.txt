1. 
BLEST be the Wisdom and the Power, The Justice and the Grace,
That joined in council to restore
And save our ruined race.
2. 
Our father ate forbidden fruit,
And from his glory fell;
And we his children thus were brought To death and near to hell.
3. 
Blest be the Lord who sent His Son,
To take our flesh and blood.
To bring us life He gave His own,
And made our peace with God.
4. 
He honoured all His Father's laws Which we have disobeyed;
Ile bore our sins upon the cross,
And our full ransom paid.
5. 
Behold Him rising from the grave,
Behold Him raised on high;
He pleads His merit there to save
Transgressors doomed to die.
6. 
There on a glorious throne He reigns, And by His power divine
Redeems us from the slavish chains Of Satan and of sin.
7. 
Thence soon the Son of God shall come, And with archangel voice
Shall call His saints forth from the tomb While living saints rejoice.

1. 
Lo! the infant Saviour lies,
He appears in lowly guise,
Yet by faith we read the words�King of kings and Lord of lords.
2. 
See! He stands at Pilate's bar, Most despised of all by far; Still to Him belong the words�
King of kings and Lord of lords.
3. 
He who wears the crown of thorns, He whom man reviles and scorns, Yet demands as His the words�King of kings and Lord of lords.
4. 
On the cross 'tis still the same, Never can He yield His claim To those ever glorious words-- King of kings and Lord of lords.
5. 
Past the conflict of His love, See He takes His place above;
On His vesture shine the words�King of kings and Lord of lords.
3 NEANDER
1.
ON this Lordly day assembled, Gathered by the call of God,
We rejoice, though once we trembled, Fearing His avenging rod;
Christ redeemed us;
Let us trace the path He trod:
2. 
In the Babe in David's city,
Lowly in a manger laid,
We behold the Lord Almighty,
Him by whom the world was made. What a wonder,
God in human form arrayed!
3. 
Mark the earnest Workman toiling,
Faithful to His task and true,
Deeming nought of labour soiling That His kingly hands would do.
Man so perfect;
Holy, noble, humble too.
4. 
View the Man of Sorrows, treading
Earth's dark vale of sin and woe, Love and healing mercy spreading
Everywhere His footsteps go.
Pattern Servant,
Doing all God's will below.
5. 
Now upon the cross suspended,
See the Saviour crucified;
Slain by men His love befriended, Who His agonies deride.
Yet for sinners,
'Neath the wrath of God He died.
6. 
His atoning work completed
Now He lives no more to die.
On the Father's throne He's seated, See Him victor-crowned on high.
Hallelujah!
'Tis by Him we now draw nigh.
7.  For His birth and life obedient
To Thy perfect holy will,
For His death, no mere expedient,
But Thy counsels to fulfil,
We Thy people,
Blessed God, would praise Thee still.
8. 
Praise the Father, for He gave us
Gift most precious in His Son. Praise the Son, for He to save us
Such a mighty work has done.
Praise the Spirit
Who revealed it;
Praise Jehovah, Three in One.
Amen.
4 ALL FOR JESUS
FROM the realm of light and glory
Came the Son of God as Man, To unfold the wondrous story
Veiled in God's eternal plan.
2. 
Leaving heaven's throne of splendour,
Stepping down to earth's dark night�Shepherds find Him in a manger,
Gaze in wonder at the sight!
3. 
Woman's Seed in Eden promised,
God incarnate, virgin-born;
Morning Star by men unnoticed,
Herald of a glorious dawn.
4.  
As Jehovah's Servant treading Sin-stained earth with heavenly grace, Ever onward, never faltering�
All His steps we love to trace.
5. 
On the cross, His will unshaken,
Dying, outcast, crushed, alone; Visage marred, by God forsaken,
There for sinners to atone.
6. 
Victor over death and Hades,
Foes all vanquished 'neath His feet, To the Father's side He rises,
There to take the highest seat!
7.
Tribute bring we to the Father
For the Son, His gift of love; Bowing low, our praise we offer
In the holy place above.
5 BLESSED NAME
1.
WE bless and praise Thee, gracious God, For giving Thine own Son,
Who did partake of flesh and blood, In all our sorrows one.
Well may we wonder at the thought
That Christ came down so low,
That He so near to us was brought To understand our woe.
2. 
He, mingling with the human race,
Saw sin, death, Satan's power; Before His holy piercing gaze
The very demons cower.
But not alone in living strife
He fought the triple foe; Upon the cross He gave His life;
By dying laid them low.
3. 
For us He died upon the tree,
For us was shed His blood,
But more than that since unto Thee
He gave Himself, 0 God.
Christ, spotless, offered Thee Himself,
Oh, what a gift divine!
Its fragrant worth no tongue can tell,
What joy, 0 God, was Thine!
4. 
In the eternal Spirit He
Offered Himself to God; And in the Holy Spirit we
Now sing a grateful ode.
For now He lives, we praise Thy name,
He lives no more to die;
'Tis ours to celebrate His fame,
Who sits with Thee on high.
5. 
Before Thy face we own His grace, He once for us was poor.
We bless His name, we sing His fame, He liveth evermore.
Our hymn of praise with joy we raise, His worth no tongue can tell.
So great His love all praise above,
He hath done all things well.
6 ST. ALPHEGE
1. 
SENT from th' eternal Father
Who dwells in light above,
Came forth the Son most holy To manifest His love.
2. 
This is the wondrous story
Born of a Hebrew maid The Lord of life and glory;
And in a manger laid.
3. 
He grew in human stature,
In every childlike grace; He lived a life most holy
In all His youthful days;
4. 
Attaining manhood's ripeness,
Midst sinners sinless He;
And though in human likeness,
From human errors free.
5. 
He entered on His life-work, Approved by God Most High; When tempted in the desert
He made the Tempter fly.
6. 
In Galilee behold Him
A simple wedding-guest,
But mighty powers enfold Him, Believing ones are blest.
7. 
Through this dark vale of sorrow
He, clothed with pity, went. In Him each sick and sad one
Found power and mercy blent.
8. 
But looming black before Him
See His dread cross appear; Oh, well may we adore Him,
He bore our sorrows there!
9. 
Then glory to the Father,
For us His Son He gave;
To Christ, Kinsman-Redeemer,
He died our souls to save;
10. 
To God th' eternal Spirit,
'Tis He reveals the Son; We praise Thy holy merit,
Jehovah, Three in One.

1. 
'Tis midnight, and on Olive's brow 
The star is dimmed that lately shone; 
'Tis midnight in the garden now,
The suffering Saviour prays alone.
2. 
'Tis midnight, and from all removed 
The Saviour wrestles 'lone with fears; 
E'en that disciple whom He loved 
Heeds not his Master's grief and tears.
3. 
'Tis midnight, agonized He kneels,
The sweat falls down like drops of blood; 
Yet He who such deep anguish feels
Is not forsaken by His God.
4. 
'Tis midnight, but before Him loom 
Yet darker hours of deeper woe; 
Golgotha's anguish, death, the tomb, 
The patient Saviour needs must know.
5.
0 God, those midnight scenes of woe In tenderest memory we recall;
We bless the One who loved us so, And fully own that Christ is all.
8 REST
1. 
THE Son of God, the Prince of life,
Thrice in the garden prayed;
The sword was drawn to pierce the One
On whom our sins were laid.
2. 
He asked, if it were possible, The cup might pass away;
Made flesh for us, the Son of God A prostrate suppliant lay.
3. 
Strong crying, tears and sweat like blood Bespeak His agony,
Yet must He sink in deeper grief
That we might never die.
4. 
The sword awakened cannot rest
Till God has slain His Son;
The Christ must die on Golgotha
For my sin to atone.
5. 
Go to Gethsemane, my soul,
Watch with the Saviour there; Ponder His pretaste of the cup,
Then to the cross repair. 
9 EDEN
1.
BEHOLD a spotless Victim dies,
Our surety on the cross;
The Lamb of God the sacrifice,
He gave Himself for us.
2. 
Whatever curse was ours He bore,
The wormwood and the gall;
There in that lone mysterious hour
Our cup He drained it all.
3. 
The Lord Himself and none beside Its bitterness could know,
Nor other tell the joy's full tide That from that cup shall flow.
4. 
The joy is His, yet wondrous grace, That joy to us is given;
Our joy to His sorerief we trace, His death brings life and heaven.
5. 
And, while the ages roll along,
This shall our glory be,
And this the new and endless song His love to us, to me.

10 DURHAM
1. 
THE Lamb of God to slaughter led, The King of glory see,
A crown of thorns upon His head; They nail Him to the tree.
2. 
The Father gives His only Son, The King of glory dies
For us the guilty and undone, A spotless sacrifice.
3. 
Thy name is holy, 0 our God,
Before Thy throne we bow; The holy place is our abode,
We know Thy mercy now.
4. 
Enthroned with Thee now sits the Lord, And in Thy bosom dwells.
Justice that smote Him with the sword Our perfect pardon seals.
5. 
Eternal death was once our doom,
Now death has lost its sting; Triumphant through His empty tomb,
Thy power and love we sing. 
11 ST. JUDE
1. 
GAZING On the Lord in glory While our hearts in worship bow, There we read the wondrous story Of the cross, its shame and woe.
2. 
Every mark of dark dishonour Heaped upon the thorn-crowned brow, All the depths of His heart's sorrow Told in answering glory now.
3. 
On that cross alone, forsaken,
Where no pitying eye was found; Now to God's right hand exalted�With His praise the heavens resound.
4. 
Did His God e'en then forsake Him, Hide Himself from His deep need?
In that face, once marred and smitten, All His glory now we read.
5. 
Rise, our hearts, and bless the Father; Ceaseless song e'en here begun�Endless praise and adoration
To the Father and the Son. Amen.
12 caPOHR
1. 
How deep and grievous was the woe Of Christ upon the cross!
It laid the mighty Saviour low
When hanging there for us.
To bring us gain He bare the pain,
And suffered shame and loss.
2. 
The wage of sin was in our cup,
Wrath filled it to the brim;
Its bitterness we'll never sup,
That cup was drunk by Him. 'Twas all for us He suffered thus, That we might live through Him.
3. 
There rose a keen relentless storm, It burst on Christ alone;
It marred His visage and His form,
But thus He saved His own. He bore the grief for our relief,
Unaided and alone.
4. 
Jehovah's righteous anger dire
Fell on His only Son;
He bare the brunt of all God's ire,
And thus our peace was won.
The stripes were sore the Saviour bore; God spared not His Son.
5. 
His wrathful sword was raised to smite
The One who pleased Him well; On Him in whom He had delight
The bitter chastening fell.
Our peace He made, the price He paid; His love no tongue can tell.
6. 
It was for us Christ Jesus died, A Victim on the cross,
Revealing thus the boundless tide Of love He has to us.
He is our Lord alone adored Who died upon the cross.
7. 
The One who suffered grief and shame Is raised and glorified.
We sing the triumph of His name
Who groaned and bled and died. We celebrate His triumph great;
He's raised and glorified.
13 ROCKINGHAM
1. 
As we survey the wondrous cross On which the Lord of glory died, Our richest gains we count but loss, And pour contempt on all our pride.
2. 
Forbid that we should ever boast
Save in the cross of Christ, 0 God;
All the vain things that charmed us most, We sacrifice them to His blood.
3. 
See from His head, His hands, His feet, Sorrow and love flow mingled down; Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?
4. 
Were the whole realm of nature ours, That were an offering far too small; Love that transcends our highest powers Demands our heart, our life, our all.

14 Sr. SYLVESTER
1. 
STRICKEN, smitten and afflicted,
Lo. He dies upon the tree;
'Tis the Christ by man rejected.
Son of God, 'tis He, 'tis He!
2. 
'Tis the long-expected Saviour,
David's Son and David's Lord, Sacrificed to show us favour
And declare the love of God.
3
Mark the sacrifice appointed,
See who hears the awful load; 'Tis the Word, the Lord's Anointed, Son of Man and Son of God!
4.
Lamb of God, for sinners wounded,
Sacrifice which cancels guilt; None shall ever be confounded
Who on Him their hopes have built.
15 ABERYSTWYTH
NAILLI) upon Golgotha's tree, Faint and bleeding, who is He? Hands and feet so rudely torn,
Wreathed with crown of twisted thorn. Once He lived in heaven above, Happy in His Father's love;
Son of God, 'tis He, 'tis He, Nailed upon Golgotha's tree.
2. 
Nailed upon Golgotha's tree, Mocked and taunted, who is He? Scorners tell Him to come down, Claim His kingdom and His crown. He it was who came to bless,
Full of love and tenderness; Son of Man, 'Os He, 'tis He, Nailed upon Golgotha's tree.
3. 
Nailed upon Golgotha's tree, As a Victim, who is He? Bearing sin, but not His own, Suffering agony unknown. He, the promised sacrifice,
For the sinner bleeds and dies; Lamb of God, 'tis He, 'tis He, Nailed upon Golgotha's tree.
16	SIELL A
1. 
0 LovE divine, what hast thou done! The Christ of God for us hath bled; The Father's co-eternal Son
Had all our sins upon Him laid. The Son of God for us hath died, Our Lord, our Life was crucified.
2. 
Was crucified for us in shame
To bring us rebels back to God. So may we glory in His name,
As those redeemed by precious blood. Pardon and fife flowed from His side, When He our Lord was crucified.
3
Then let us glory in the cross, [theme; Make Christ our boast, our constant All things for Him account but loss, And now for Him despise the shame. Let nought with Him our hearts divide Since He for us was crucified.
17 HUSHED WAS THE EVENING HYMN
1. 
HIMSELF He could not save, He on the cross must die, Or mercy could not come To ruined sinners nigh.
Yes, Christ the Son of God must bleed,
That sinners might from sin be freed.
2. 
Himself He could not save, For justice must be done, Our sins' full weight must fall Upon the sinless One.
For nothing less could God accept In payment of that fearful debt.
3. 
Himself He could not save, Love's stream too deeply flowed,
In love Himself He gave
To pay the debt we owed. Obedience to the Father's will And love to Him did all fulfil.
4. 
Himself He could not save,
But now exalted high,
A Prince and Saviour He
Has saved and brought us nigh. We live in Him who lives above,
And sing with joy His deathless love.
18t EWING
1.
THE Author of salvation Was offered on the tree,
His deep humiliation
In symbol here we see.
We, by the Spirit guided,
To Golotha repair;
The Lamb that God provided Was slaughtered for us there.
2.
The sword of God was bidden
His Holy One to smite,
Jehovah's face was hidden
In terrors from His sight.
God's tokens had declared Him
His Son who pleased Him well;
He pierced His soul, nor spared Him
When bruised by earth and hell.
3.
Justice, our guilt to cover. Awoke the wrathful storm;
Dismay seized friend and lover,
He said, " I am a worm.-
He was of God forsaken,
As One by God abhorred,
The sinner's place was taken By Him our glorious Lord.
4. 
His God who duly prized Him,
Whose statutes He did keep,
In floods of death baptized Him,
In sorrow's lowest deep.
He was the Father's treasure, The Christ whom He had sent; His righteous sore displeasure
On Him for us was spent.
5. 
We on to ruin hurried,
To misery's abyss,
But dead with Him and buried,
And raised to share His bliss, We sing with hearts united
His cross for evermore;
Once like the world benighted,
His name we now adore. Amen.

19 TRICHINOPOLY
1.
THE head once full of bruises,
So full of pain and scorn,
Midst other sore abuses
Mocked with a crown of thorn, That head is now surrounded
With brightest majesty;
In death once bowed and wounded, Accursed on the tree.

20t MUNICH
1.
No bone of Him was broken�The spotless paschal Lamb; Of life and peace a token
To us who know His name. The Head for all the members
The curse, the vengeance bore, And God, our God, remembers
His people's sins no more.



2. 
That countenance transcendent, That life-creating Sun
To worlds on Him dependent,
Was bruised and spit upon! That which His soul tormented
Was our sins' heavy load, We had the debt augmented
Which He then paid in blood.
3. 
And oh! what consolation
Doth in our hearts take place, When we His toil and passion Can joyfully retrace.
Ah! should we while thus musing On our Redeemer's cross,
E'en life itself be losing,
Great gain would be that loss.
4. 
We give Thee thanks unfeigned
For Him the Friend in need, For what His soul sustained
When He for us did bleed. And now we rest unshaken
Upon His faithfulness,
Until we hence are taken
To see Him face to face. 
We, the redeemed, are reaping
What Christ did sow in tears, The feast which we are keeping
His name to us endears. It tells of Justice hiding
From Him the face of God, Proud men around deriding
His sorrow's awful load.
5. 
His death of shame and sorrow
Was like unto His birth,
Which would no glory borrow,
No majesty from earth. As pilgrims we are hasting
To our eternal home, Its joy already tasting
Of victory o'er the tomb.
6. 
His life and death reviewing,
We tread the narrow way;
Our homeward path pursuing,
We watch the dawn of day.
We eat and drink with gladness
The broken bread and wine, And sing with sweetest sadness
Our song of love divine.

21 DUNSTAN
1. 
CROWNED with thorns upon the tree, Silent in His agony,
Dying crushed beneath the load
Of the wrath and curse of God.
2. 
On His pale and suffering brow, Mystery of love and woe;
On His grief and sore amaze We would fix our earnest gaze.
3. 
Sin-atoning sacrifice,
Oh how precious in our eyes! He alone our rest shall be, Now and through eternity.
22 MAINZER
1. 
SWEET is the savour of His name Who suffered in His people's stead; His portion here reproach and shame, He liveth now, He once was dead.
2. 
He once was dead, the very same Who sits on yonder throne above, Who bears in heaven the greatest name, Whom angels serve, whom angels love.
3. 
He once was dead, the very same Who made the worlds, a work of power, Who now upholds the mighty frame, And keeps it till the final hour.
4. 
He once was dead; but now He lives, His glory fills all heaven above;
Its blessedness to heaven He gives, The fountain He of joy and love.
5. 
His people shall His triumph share, With Him shall live and with Him reign, In heaven their joy is full, for there They see Him who for them was slain.

1. 
LET us join our God to bless For His Son our righteousness,
Him who bowed His head so low Underneath our load of woe.
2. 
His the curse, the wounds, the gall, His the stripes, He bore them all; His the dying cry of pain
When our sins He did sustain.
3. 
He, the accepted sacrifice,
From the vanquished grave did rise. Free Himself, He set us free
In His perfect liberty.
4. 
Praise our God who willed it thus, Praise His Son who died for us, Praise the Father for the Son
Who so vast a work hath done.

Shall His praise unuttered lie?
Who would hush the heaven-sent story
Of the One who came to die?
2. 
Came from Godhead's fullest glory
Down to Calvary's depth of woe; Now on high, we bow before Him,
Streams of praises ceaseless flow.
3. 
Sing His blest triumphant rising,
He is on the Father's throne;
Sing till heaven and earth surprising
He shall reign and He alone.

SPOTLESS Lamb by God provided!
Here upon His face we gaze,
Where the Father's love and glory
Shine in all their brightest rays. His almighty power and wisdom
All creation's works proclaim;
Heaven and earth alike confess Him
As the ever great I AM.
2. 
Lamb of God, His Father's bosom Ever was His dwelling-place; His delight, in Him rejoicing,
One with Him in power and grace. Oh, what wondrous love and mercy Thus to lay His glory by,
And for us to come from heaven
As the Lamb of God to die!
3. 
Lamb of God, when we behold Him 
Lowly in the manger laid,
Wandering as a homeless Stranger 
In the world His hands had made, 
When we see Him in the garden. 
Anguish forcing drops like blood, 
At His grace we are confounded, 
Holy, spotless Lamb of God!
4. 
When we see Him as the Victim
Bound upon Golgotha's cross, For our guilt and folly stricken,
Bearing judgment due to us,
Lord, we own, with hearts adoring,
He has loved us unto blood; Glory, glory everlasting
Be unto the Lamb of God!

For the Son of God, who came 
Ruined sinners to reclaim. 
Hallelujah! what a Saviour!

Bearing shame and scoffing rude, 
In my place condemned He stood, 
Sealed my pardon with His blood.
Hallelujah! what a Saviour!

Guilty, vile, and helpless we, 
Spotless Lamb of God was He; 
Full atonement can it be?
Hallelujah! what a Saviour!
4. 
Lifted up was He to die,
"It is finished," was His cry, 
Now in heaven exalted high,
Hallelujah! what a Saviour!

5.
When He comes, the glorious King,
All His ransomed home to bring,
Then anew this song we'll sing, 
Hallelujah! what a Saviour!

1
THE love of God, it melts our hearts, Like ice before the sun;
And fills our eyes with grateful tears,
Such wonders it has done.
2.
When Justice stern in wrath arose
With sword uplift and keen, Poor helpless sinners to dispatch,
God's love did intervene.
3
Between that mighty sword and us
Came God's beloved Son.
That fearful stroke, it fell on Him,
And life for us was won.
4. 
God's love to us will never cease, Unlimited it flows;
As from an everlasting spring It faileth not, but grows.
5. 
Then unto God be glory given,
And let us praise Him now
For wondrous love through Christ
displayed,
While at His throne we bow.
28 GOD IS LOVE
God is love, His word has said it,
This is news of heavenly birth; In our hearts His Spirit shed it,
Made us know it here on earth,
That God is love. 
Not in yonder blessed regions
Where the Lord, in glory crowned, Reigns amid angelic legions,
Will the brightest proof be found That God is love.
6. 
'Tis on earth the Lord discloses
All His love how vast it is;
Earth's the favoured spot He chooses
To display the truth of this�
That God is love.
7. 
'Tis that Man of Sorrows yonder,
Object of contempt beneath,
But in heaven of highest wonder,
Teaches fully by His death
That God is love.
8. 
His a throne, the throne of heaven,
Yet He comes to earth to bleed, And for man His life is given.
This is what declares indeed
That God is love.
9. 
Not for those who ever loved Him Did the Lord of glory die;
Pity to the wretched moved Him, Who that hears it will deny That God is love?
10. 
Let us lowly now adore Him,
Triune God of love and grace;
Joyful bow the knee before Him,
Laud His goodness, sound His praise, For God is love.

29 DUKE STREET
0 BLESSED God, our voice we raise
To speak Thy worth and sing Thy praise, For love that made Thee give Thy Son For sinners ruined and undone.
2. 
On Him by Thee our sins were laid, When He for sin atonement made; Our every sin was known to Thee, He bore them that we might be free.
3. 
Such love we cannot comprehend,
That Thou for us Thy Son shouldst send To bear such heavy load of woe,
To pay the debt that we did owe.
4. 
But this we know, Thy Son did die To bring us guilty sinners nigh. Now all the work is fully done, We stand accepted in Thy Son.
5. 
And now we wait the happy day When He will take His own away, Far from this scene of care and strife, To dwell with Him in endless life.
6. 
Till then, 0 God, be this our aim, To celebrate His wondrous name,
To praise the love that made Thee give Thy Son to die that we might live.
30 MERIRAH
1.
0 GOD, to Thee our voice we lift In praise for every perfect gift
Thou sendest from above.
In daily boons bestowed by Thee Thou hast declared Thyself to be
A God of grace and love. 
But oh, Thy Son, from heaven sent, Has love's unlimited extent,
Its shoreless ocean, shown.
For Him, our songs to Thee we raise In thankful gratitude and praise,
The gift that makes Thee known.
7. 
What love it was, that Thou shouldst give Thy Son to death that we might live, Who bore no love to Thee!
No thanks we gave for aught bestowed, But by our every action showed
What enemies were we.
8. 
But now we love, for love expressed In giving us Thy very best�
Thy well-beloved Son.
We praise Thee, worship and adore, Who opened thus love's boundless store And gave that blessed One.
9. 
Oh, wondrous gift, in whom we find Thine every heavenly gift combined; Our all-in-all is He.
Our life, our peace, our righteousness; All that we have and shall possess, We have in Him, from Thee.
10. 
To Thee is highest glory due, And ages shall its weight accrue,
For this that Thou hast done. So now we'd join that mighty song That age on age shall echo on,
Praise for Thy gift�Thy Son.

Who gave for us His well-beloved Son, The gift of gifts, all other gifts in one; Blessed be God, our God!
2. 
What will He not bestow,
Who gave for us this mighty gift unbought, Unmerited, unheeded, and unsought? What will He not bestow?
3. 
He spared not His Son!
'Tis this that silences each rising fear,
'Tis this that bids the hard thought disappear;
He spared not His Son!
4. 
Who shall condemn us now,
Since Christ has died and risen and gone above, For us to plead at the right hand of Love? Who shall condemn us now?
5. 
'Tis God that justifies!
Who shall recall His pardon or His grace?
Or who the broken chain of guilt replace?
'Tis God that justifies!
6. 
The victory is ours!

All sights above.
Jesus the curse sustains,
Guilt's bitter cup He drains, Nothing for us remains,
Nothing but love.
3. 
Love that no tongue can teach, Love that no thought can reach, No love like His.
God is its blessed source,
Death ne'er can stop its course, Nothing can stay its force, Matchless it is.

To God our praises bring,
All sins forgiven.
Honour and majesty
Now and for ever be
To the blest Trinity,
Here and in heaven. Amen.

WHAT was it, 0 our God, Led Thee to give Thy Son, To yield Thy Well-beloved For us by sin undone?
'Twas love unbounded led Thee thus
To give Thy Well-beloved for us.
2. 
What led the Son of God
To leave His throne on high, To shed His precious blood, To suffer and to die?
'Twas love, unbounded love to us, Led Him to die and suffer thus.
3. 
What moved Thee to impart Thy Spirit from above,
Therewith to fill each heart
With heavenly peace and love? 'Twas love, unbounded love to us, Moved Thee to give Thy Spirit thus.
4. 
What doth the Spirit move, Within us to abide,
To teach us all Thy love,
And tell of Him who died?
'Tis love unbounded moves Him thus To condescend to dwell with us.
5. 
What love to Thee we owe, 0 God, for all Thy grace! Our hearts should overflow In everlasting praise.
Help us, 0 God, to praise Thee thus For all Thy boundless love to us.

And better hopes above;

Who bought us with His blood From everlasting woe;
And now He lives and soon will reign
To see the fruit of all His pain.

Eternal thanks we give,
Whose new-creating power
Makes the dead sinner live;
His work completes the great design And fills the soul with joy divine.

Be endless honours done,
The undivided Three
And self-existent One;
Where reason fails with all her powers, There faith prevails and love adores.

THE happy morn is come; Triumphant o'er the grave The Saviour leaves the tomb, Almighty now to save. Captivity is captive led,
Since Jesus liveth, who was dead.
2. 
Who now accuseth them
For whom the Surety died? Or who shall those condemn Whom God hath justified? Captivity is captive led,
Since Jesus liveth, who was dead.
3. 
Christ hath the ransom paid, The glorious work is done; On Him our help was laid, The victory is won.
Captivity is captive led,
Since Jesus liveth, who was dead.

To the incarnate Word
Eternal honours be.
Captivity is captive led,
Since Jesus liveth, who was dead.

In all His works behold Him great, Before, almighty to create,
Almighty now to save.

The First-begotten from the dead, He's risen now, His people's Head, And thus their life's secure.
And if like Him they yield their breath, Like Him they'll burst the bonds of Their resurrection sure.	[death,

Why should His people then be sad? None have such reason to be glad
As those redeemed to God. Jesus the mighty Saviour lives, To them eternal life He gives,
The purchase of His blood.

45 ST. MICHAEL'S
1
His be the Victor's name
Who fought the fight alone; Triumphant saints no honour claim, Their conquest was His own.
2. 
By weakness and defeat
He won the meed and crown; Trod all our foes beneath His feet By being trodden down.
3. 
He hell in hell laid low,
Made sin, He sin o'erthrew,
Bowed to the grave, destroyed it so, And death by dying slew.
4. 
Bless, bless the Conqueror slain, Slain in His victOry,
Who lived, who died, who lives again
For thee, His Church, for thee.

46 ST. MAGNUS
1
BEHOLD the Lord with glory crowned, To Him all power is given;
No place too high for Him is found, No place too high in heaven.
2.
He fills the throne, the throne above, He fills it without wrong;
The object of His Father's love,
The theme of angels' song.
3
Though high yet He presents the praise God's people offer here;
The faintest, feeblest lay they raise
Will reach the Father's ear.
4. 
This song be ours, and this alone That celebrates the fame
Of Him who sits upon the throne, And that exalts His name.
5. 
To Him whom men despise and slight, To Him be glory given.
The crown is His, and His by right
The highest place in heaven.

The mighty Victor's brow. 
Delight of all who dwell above, The joy of saints below,
To us He manifests His love That we its depths may know.
6. 
To us His cross with all its shame, With all its grace is given;
Though earth disowns the lowly name, All worship it in heaven.
7. 
To us His cross is life and health,
Though shame and death to Him; Our present glory, joy, and wealth,
Our never-ending theme.
48 SOUTHWELL
1
THE Son of God, who dwelt in light Unreached by mortal eye,
Came forth as man the foe to fight, And won the victory.
2.
In perfect light was sin made bare, It met its utmost due;
While perfect love in triumph there Revealed salvation too.
3
Who but the sinless One could be
Sin-offering meet for God?
And who in heaven or earth save He Could cleanse us with His blood?
4.
Exalted now at God's right hand He sits enthroned above;
Eternal proof that God is just, And proof that God is love.

49 DUNFERMLINE
1
FOR whom is yonder crown prepared, Of workmanship divine?
For Jesus is the bright reward,
For Him its glories shine.
2. 
Beneath the earth awhile He lies,
A Prisoner with the dead.
A Victor soon the Lord will rise,
And glory wreathe His head.
3. 
He saw the cross, despised its shame,
And bowed beneath its weight.
For this He bears the greatest name,
And gains the highest seat.
4. 
To Him shall every knee be bowed,
His claim shall angels own,
Around the rising Victor croWd
And bear Him to the throne.
5. 
We think we see the glorious King By hosts angelic owned;
They shout and heaven's high arches ring With the triumphant sound.
6. 
Let saints on earth their tribute bring, And echo back the sound,
For He who saves them is the King By hosts angelic owned.
50 STUTTGART
1. 
HARK, ten thousand voices crying,
"Lamb of God," with one accord! Thousand, thousand saints replying
Wake at once the echoing chord.
2. 
Praise the Lamb! the chorus waking,
All in heaven together throng; Loud and far, each tongue partaking,
Rolls along the endless song.
3. 
Grateful incense this ascending
Ever to the Father's throne; Every knee to Jesus bending,
All the mind of heaven is one.
4. 
All the Father's counsels claiming
Equal honours to the Son;
All the Son's effulgence beaming Makes the Father's glory known.
5. 
By the Spirit all pervading,
Hosts unnumbered round the Lamb Crowd with light and joy unfading, Hail Him as the great I AM.
6.

Rests in undisturbed repose, Blest in Jesus' full salvation
Sorrow now nor thraldom knows.

Joy responsive "Amen ! " raises, Hallelujah, and Amen!

SHERBORNE

KING of kings and Lord of lords�These great awe-inspiring words Unto Christ the Lord belong;

1.  HALLELUJAH!
The strife is o'er, the battle done, The triumph of Jehovah won;
Oh, let the song of praise be sung,
Hallelujah!
2. 
The powers of death have done their worst,
Christ Jesus hath His foes dispersed;
Let shouts of praise and joy outburst,
Hallelujah!
3.  On that third day He rose again
In glorious majesty to reign;
Oh, let us swell the joyful strain,
Hallelujah!

5. 
When we think of love like this, Joy and shame our hearts possess; Joy that He could pity thus, Shame for such return from us.
6. 
Yet we soon the day shall see When we shall from sin be free, Borne aloft, to heaven brought, There to praise God as we ought.
4. 

He overcame the power of hell,
The bars from heaven's high portals fell; Let songs of joy His triumph tell, Hallelujah!
5. 
He died upon Golgotha's tree,
From death's dread sting to set us free, That we, 0 God, may sing to Thee Hallelujah! Amen.

53 RESURRECTION
HARK, ten thousand voices cry,
Victory! through the sky.
Swiftly flies the welcome sound, Spreading rapturous joy around.
2. 
Jesus comes, His conflict over,
Comes to claim His great reward; Angels round the Victor hover,
Crowding to behold their Lord.
3. 
Oh, what honours.now await Him!
Friends and foes shall hear His voice; Tremble, tremble, ye that hate Him.
Ye who love His name rejoice.
4. 
Yonder throne for Him erected
Now becomes the Victor's seat, Lo, the Man on earth rejected,
Angels worship at His feet!
5. 
Day and night they cry before Him, Holy, holy, holy Lord.
All the powers of heaven adore Him, All obey His sovereign word.
6. 
Then haste, ye saints, your tribute bring And laud the everlasting King;
Laud Him,
Laud the everlasting King. 
54 MIGDOL
Look, ye saints, the sight is glorious,
See the Man of Sorrows now!
From the fight returned victorious,
Every knee to Him shall bow.
God has crowned Him,
Hallelujah!
Crowns become the Victor's brow.
2. 
See the Saviour God has crowned!
Rich the trophies that He brings; In the seat of power enthroned,
While the vault of heaven rings.
Hallelujah!
God has crowned Him,
Crowned the Saviour King of kings.
3. 
Sinners in derision crowned Him,
Mocking thus the Saviour's claim; Saints and angels crowd around Him,
Own His title, praise His name.
God has crowned Him,
Hallelujah!
Sing aloud the Victor's fame.
4. 
Hark! those bursts of acclamation, Hark ! those loud triumphant chords ; Jesus takes the highest station,
Oh, what joy the sight affords! Hallelujah!
God has crowned Him,
King of kings and Lord of lords.

55 DISMISSION

Christ the Lord, the Living One; All His toil on earth completed,
All His work for sinners done.

See Him, God's eternal Son.

Every tongue confess His name.
Ransomed myriads shall adore Him
Who endured the cross and shame.
From the glory
God doth now His worth proclaim.
3. 
Man to Him the cross awarded,
Man the Saviour crucified;
This world's judgment stands recorded, God's own nature glorified.
By the glory
Christ was claimed on earth who died.
4. 
Son of Man, His incarnation
Opened first the tale of grace. Son of Man, in new creation
Leader of a chosen race.
Well may glory
Own Him in the highest place. 56 ST. GEORGE'S EORGE'S WINDSOR
1. 
CROWNS of glory ever bright Rest upon the Victor's head. Crowns of glory are His right, His who liveth and was dead. Jesus fought and won the day, Such a day was never fought! Well His people now may say, See what God, our God, has wrought.
2. 
He subdued the powers of hell; In the fight He stood alone; All His foes before Him fell, By His single arm o'erthrown.
They have fallen to rise no more, Final is the foes' defeat;
Jesus triumphed by His power, And His triumph is complete.
3. 
His the fight, the arduous toil, His the honours of the day, His the glory and the spoil, Jesus bears them all away. Now exalt His peerless name, Sing aloud of His renown�His the never-dying fame,
His the well-deserved crown!

57 LUTHER'S HYMN
1
THE Lord of glory! Who is He?
Who is the King of glory? Only the Son of God can be
The Christ, the King of glory. Consider all His wounds, and see How Jesus' death upon the tree
Proclaims Him King of glory.
2. 
Above all heavens at God's right hand
Now sits the King of glory.
The angels by His favour stand
Before the throne of glory;
Swiftly they fly at His command
To guard His own of every land,
To keep the heirs of glory.
3. 
Death and the grave confess the Lamb To be the King of glory;
The powers of darkness dread His name, Creation shows His glory.
He said, " Ere Abra'am was I am,' Jesus is evermore the same
Th' Almighty King of glory.
4. 
Thrice happy who in Him believe,
They soon shall share His glory; Born of His Spirit, they receive
His secret pledge of glory.
Taught by His cross. for sin they grieve; He calls them brethren, and they cleave
To Him, their hope of glory. 
58 EGYPT
1. 
THE mighty work is done; He who the victory won
No more will die; He lives on high,
His triumph loud we sing,
Our praise to God we bring�
Hallelujah !
God has raised Him from the dead; Now He lives our glorious Head.
2. 
He entered heaven by blood; Upon the throne of God
He sitteth now: to Him all bow; His priceless worth we sing, Our praise to God we bring�
Hallelujah!
God has seated Him on high, And by Him we are brought nigh.
3. 
He comes soon to the air,
And we shall meet Him there,
Oh glorious hour of heavenly power! Then gladsome songs we'll sing, And heaven's high vault shall ring.
Hallelujah!
We shall know His love and grace When we look upon His face.
4. 
He comes to earth to reign, The Lamb that once was slain.
His bounteous hand in every land Proclaims Him heaven's King. All people then shall sing�
Hallelujah!
Soon He comes to earth again
As the King of kings to reign.

1. 
THE veil is rent! Lo, Jesus sits
Upon a throne of grace;
The incense which His name emits
Fills all that glorious place.
2. 
His precious blood is sprinkled there Before and on the throne,
And His own wounds in heaven declare His work on earth is done.
3. 
" 'Tis finished," on the cross He said In agonies and blood;
" 'Tis finished," now He lives to plead Before the face of God.
4. 
" 'Tis finished," here our souls can rest, His work can never fail;
By Him, our sacrifice and Priest,
We enter through the veil.
5. 
Within the Holiest of all,
Cleansed by His precious blood, Before Thy throne Thy people fall And worship Thee, 0 God.
6. 
Boldly our heart and voice we raise, His name, His blood, our plea, Assured our sacrifice of praise
Ascends by Him to Thee. I.
'Tis past, the dark and dreary night; 0 God, we see Him now,
Our morning Star, without a cloud Of sadness on His brow.
2. 
His path on earth, the cross, the grave, His sorrows, all are o'er;
And oh, sweet thought ! His eye shall weep, His heart shall break no more.
3. 
Deep were those sorrows, deeper still
The love that brought Him low,
That bade the streams of life from Him
A lifeless Victim flow.
4. 
The soldier, as he pierced Him, proved Man's hate to Him and Thee,
Whilst in the blood that stained the spear His love and Thine we see.
5. 
It is not that we know the joy
Of cancelled sin alone,
But happier far, the saints are called
To share His glorious throne.
6. 
So closely are we linked in love (As dear as He to Thee)
That all His bliss and glory soon
Our portion blest shall be.

1. 
DONE iS the work that saves, Once and for ever done!
Finished the righteousness
That clothes th' unrighteous one! The love that blesses us below
Is flowing freely to us now.
2. 
The sacrifice is o'er,
The veil is rent in twain,
The mercy-seat is red
With blood of Victim slain.
Why stand we, then, without in fear? The blood of Christ invites us near.
3. 
The gate is open wide,
The new and living way
Is clear and free and bright
With love and peace and day.
Into the Holies now we come�
Our present and eternal home.
4. 
Enthroned in majesty
The great Priest sits within.
The precious blood once shed Has made and keeps us clean.
With boldness let us now draw near,
That blood has banished every fear.
5. 
To Him who has been slain
Be glory, praise and power;
He died, and lives again,
He lives for evermore.
He loves us, cleansed us by His blood, Made us a kingdom, priests to God.

63 ST. AIDAN
1
FROM far we see the glorious day When He who bore our sins away Will all His majesty display.
2. 
A Man of Sorrows once He was;
No friend was found to plead His cause, For all preferred the world's applause.
3. 
He groaned beneath sin's awful load, For in the sinner's place He stood, And died to bring us nigh to God.
4. 
But now He reigns with glory crowned, While angel hosts the throne surround, And still His lofty praises sound.
5. 
And there is yet a day to come When He who suffered in our room Will take His waiting people home.
64 OLD 148TH
1. 
TH'ATON1NG work is done,
The Victim's blood is shed,
And Jesus now is gone
His people's cause to plead.
He lives in heaven, their great High Priest,
And bears their names upon His breast.
2. 
He sprinkled with His blood
The mercy-seat above, For Justice had withstood The purposes of Love.
But Justice now withstands no more
And Mercy yields her boundless store.
3. 
No temple made with hands His place of service is;
In heaven itself He stands,
A heavenly priesthood His;
In Him the shadows of the law
Are all fulfilled, and now withdraw.
4. 
And though awhile He be Hid from the eyes of men, His people look to see
Their great High Priest again. In brightest glory He will come And take His waiting people home.
65 DIJON
1. 
JESUS in the heavenly temple
Sits with God upon the throne, Now no more to be forsaken,
His humiliation gone.
2. 
Never more shall God the Father
Smite the Shepherd with the sword; Ne'er again shall lawless sinners
Set at nought the glorious Lord.
3
Dwelling in eternal sunshine
Of the countenance of God,
Jesus fills all heaven with incense
Of His rich atoning blood.
4.
On His heart our names are graven,
On His shoulders we are borne. For His sake the Father loves us;
Praise becomes us in return.

66 MARINERS
1
RISE, each soul, behold, 'tis Jesus! Jesus fills our wondering eyes; See Him now in glory seated
Where our sins no more can rise.
2. 
There in righteousness transcendent,
Lo, He doth in heaven appear!
Shows the blood of His atonement
As our title to be there.
3. 
All our sins were laid upon Him,
Jesus bore them on the tree;
God, who knew them, laid them on Him, And, believing, we are free.
4. 
God now brings us to His dwelling, Spreads for us a feast of love, Bids us welcome, ever telling
What our portion is above.
5. 
In that circle of God's favour,
Circle of the Father's love, All is rest, and rest for ever,
All is perfectness above.
6. 
Blessed, glorious word " for ever,"
Yes, " for ever " is the word; Nothing can the ransomed sever,
Nought divide them from the Lord.

Section 3. The Excellencies of the Lord Jesus Christ
67 ANWOTH

ERE God had built the mountains,
Or raised the fruitful hills; Before He filled the fountains
That feed the running rills; In One from everlasting,
The wonderful I AM
Found pleasures never wasting, And Wisdom was His name.
2.
When, like a tent to dwell in,
He spread the skies abroad,
And swathed about the swelling
Of ocean's mighty flood,
He wrought by weight and measure; Wisdom was with Him then; Himself the Father's pleasure,
And His the sons of men. 

3
Thus Wisdom's words discover His glory and His grace, The everlasting Lover
Of, our unworthy race.
His gracious eye surveyed us
Ere stars were seen above; In wisdom He has made us,
And died for us in love.

To have us for His own, The love no longer slighted
Which He to us has shown; In spite of all our badness,
Oh, miracle of grace!
He brings us in with gladness
Before His Father's face.

69 CREATION

1. 
COME, let us sing this song of love,
Of Him who came from heaven above; He made the worlds by His great power, And keeps them till the final hour. Creation doth His word obey,
And none can stay His hand or say "What doest Thou? Thy wonders cease." He is the God of power and peace.
2. 
He rules through heaven and earth and hell, His creatures all His wonders tell;
In His own hand He holds the seas, He guides the tide, controls the breeze; The frost, the snow, the ice, the cold, All are by His great power controlled; And yet an infant Babe He lay
In Bethlehem's manger on that day.
3. 
The One who dwells in heaven so high We see within the manger lie;
Th' eternal God, a little Child, So gentle, quiet, meek and mild. He came His Father to obey, Our sins by death to put away; Came to redeem us and to save
From sin, from death and from the grave.
4. 
To God our joyful praise we bring; His love, His power to save we sing. Our hearts adore Thee now, 0 God; We trace with joy the path He trod. With heart and voice we sing this day, And humbly we our homage pay;
We wait to see His glorious face, And evermore to sing Thy grace.

Human thought is here confounded,
'Tis too great to comprehend.
Praise the Saviour,
Magnify the sinner's Friend.
3. 
While we hear the wondrous story Of the Saviour's cross and shame,
Sing we, " Everlasting glory
Be to God and to the Lamb." Hallelujah!
Give ye glory to His name.

IN Christ the Lord our eyes behold
A thousand glories more
Than the rich gems and polished gold The sons of Aaron wore.
2.
They first their own sin-offering brought To purge themselves from sin;
His life was pure, without a spot,
And all His nature clean. 
Fresh blood as constant as the day Was on their altars spilt,
But His one offering takes away For ever all our guilt.
4. 
Their priesthood passed through several For mortal was their race;	[hands,
His never-changing office stands
Eternal as His days.

Their range was earth, nor higher soared, The heaven of heavens is His;
There, in His majesty, the Lord
A Priest for ever is.
6. 
Eternal glories crown His name,
As Prophet, Priest, and King;
Soon heaven and earth shall sound His
Each day fresh praises bring.	[fame,

3. 
How sovereign, wonderful and free His love from all eternity!
He plucked us from the jaws of hell; Christ Jesus hath done all things well.

Christ Jesus hath done all things well.
5. 
And when to that bright world we rise And sing our anthem in the skies, Above the rest this note shall swell�Christ Jesus hath done all things well.

To make the powers of darkness quail; To fear-wrung hearts gives lasting peace, Sin-burdened souls complete release.

Jesus! the name which can impart
True solace to each sorrowing heart;
Of death subdue the sting and gloom, With heavenly glory gild the tomb.
What mind can grasp, what tongue proclaim The comfort of that peerless name?
5. 
Jesus! the name through which alone Believing ones approach the throne;
To God their hearts' desires outpour
And draw from heaven's exhaustless store. What mind can grasp, what tongue proclaim The riches of that peerless name?

6.  
Jesus! the name in which shall bow Each knee in heaven, on earth, below; God glorify with one accord,
Confessing Jesus Christ as Lord. May we each day by day proclaim The glory of that peerless name.

The one unchanging claim,
The brightest hopes we gather
From Christ's most precious name. What always sounds so sweetly
In Thine unwearied ear,
Hath freed our souls completely From all our sinful fear.

The trembling sinner feareth
That God can ne'er forget, But one full payment cleareth

When nought beside could ease us
Or set our souls at large, The precious blood of Jesus Secured a full discharge.

No dread in ours remaineth,
As we His love receive. Returning ones He kisses,
And with His robe invests, His perfect love dismisses
All terror from our breasts.

Best of gifts, His Son from heaven. Hallelujah! this is love
Worthy of our God above. 
83 NEWCASTLE
THE countless multitude on high
Who tune their songs to Jesus' name, All merit of their own deny,
And Jesus' worth alone proclaim. Firm on the ground of sovereign grace They stand before Jehovah's throne; The only song in that blest place
Is, "Thou art worthy, Thou alone ! "



2. 
Hallelujah! Christ for sin
Death's dark flood has entered in, Suffered all the judgment throes, Saved us from eternal woes. Hallelujah! He arose
Victor over all His foes; Now exalted, glorified,
Sits He at His Father's side.
3. 
Hallelujah! for the grace
Giving us in Christ a place, Clothing our unworthiness
With God's perfect righteousness. Hallelujah! let us raise
Songs resounding with His praise; Hallelujah! strike the chord, Hallelujah! Praise the Lord. Amen.

Salvation's glory all be paid
To Him who sits upon the throne;
And to the Lamb, whose blood was shed" Thou, Thou art worthy, Thou alone; For Thou wast slain, and in Thy blood These robes were washed so spotless pure; Thou mad'st us kings and priests to God, For ever let Thy praise endure."
3. 
Let us with joy adopt the strain
We hope to sing for ever there
" Worthy the Lamb for sinners slain, Worthy alone the crown to wear!" Without one thought that's good to plead, Oh, what could shield us from despair, But this�though we are vile indeed,
The Lord our righteousness is there?

THOUGH all the beasts that live and feed, Upon a thousand hills should bleed,
Though all their blood should flow, The sacrifice would be in vain;
The stain of sin would still remain; Sin is not cancelled so.
2.
A better sacrifice than these
It needs, the conscience to appease, And satisfy the Lord.
No blood hath virtue to atone For man's offence, but His alone Whose title is the Word.
3. 
Jesus the Christ, on earth His name, He came, in love to sinners came,
And bowed His head and died. A full atonement now is made,
The ransom by His death is paid,
And justice satisfied.
4. 
That sinners might draw near to Him, God planned this great, this wondrous
And found the ransom too. [scheme, Let all the saints their voices raise,
And sing the great Redeemer's praise,
While endless ages flow.

We see the mighty sacrifice,
And we have peace with God: 'Tis everlasting peace.
Sure as Jehovah's name;
'Tis stable as His steadfast throne, For evermore the same.
2. 
The clouds may come and go,
And storms may sweep our sky;
This blood-sealed friendship changes not, The cross is ever nigh.
Our love is of ttimes low,
Our joy still ebbs and flows,
But peiice with Him remains the same, No change Jehovah knows.
3. 
We change, He changes not; His Christ can never die;
His love, not ours, the resting-place, His truth, not ours, the tie.
The cross still stands unchanged, Though heaven is now His home;
The mighty stone is rolled away, But yonder is His tomb.
4. 
And yonder is our peace, The grave of all our woes;
We know the Son of God has come, We know He died and rose.
We know He liveth now
At God's right hand above;
We know the throne on which He sits, We know His truth and love.

Descending from above,
That overflows our widest guilt,
Th' eternal Father's love,
Love of the Father's co-eternal Son,
Th' eternal Spirit's love�Jehovah, Three in One!

So glad, and sure, and clear;
It holds the drooping spirit up Till the long dawn appear.

Our roughest path on earth, our dreariest desert here!

And we have known redemption, Lord, From bondage worse than theirs by far; Sin held us by a stronger cord,
Yet by Thy mercy free we are.

We behold and understand
How for us He left the glory
As a Man 'mongst men to dwell, Gave His life-blood, wondrous story, Thus to rescue us from hell.
2. 
Now with holy boldness bringing
Firstfruits of our lies to God, Fruit of lips we join in singing
Jesus' praise with one accord. Many hearts as one united,
Many voices blend in one,
As we raise our loud hosannas,
Praises to our God alone.

Jesus' death and resurrection
Is the theme that fills our heart; On the cross for our redemption
He was pierced with judgment's dart. For us stricken, smitten, bruised,
For us bearing sin's vast load; All the wrath of God endured,
Paid our debt with His life's blood.
4. 
In the silent grave they lay Him,
Seal the stone and guard it well. Sheol's fetters cannot hold Him,
Powerless all the hosts of hell.

Raised to heaven's eternal throne.

Pierced with cruel thorn and spear upon Golgotha's tree. For our sins He suffered, and His body offered,
And His blood outpoured a sacrifice to Thee.
3. 
Now through Jesus' merit, gathered by the Spirit,
Here within the holy place, through Him we boldly c-_,me; Hearts and voices blending, praise to Thee ascending, Through our great High Priest we worship Thee alone.
4. 
Holy, holy, holy, humbly we adore Thee,
Honour, blessing, power and might we would ascribe to Thee ; Courts of heaven ringing with the praise were bringing,
For the One who lives our living Lord to be.

1. 
0 LORD, Thy courts we humbly tread, By Thy blest Spirit hither led;
We bring our sacrifice of praise, Adoring Thee in grateful lays.
2. 
Chosen in Christ�oh, wondrous grace; Assured by Him a heavenly place!
Ere worlds at Thy command were made, Salvation's wondrous plan was laid.
3. 
How could Thy heart such love conceive�To slay Thy Son and us receive?
To charge with guilt the Holy One, Forsake Thy well-beloved Son?
4. 
The stream of love divine alone
Through Christ could pardon and atone; Eternal ages it had flowed,
And at the cross its fulness showed.
5. 
Accepted through His death are we To be a priesthood, serving Thee.
What joy is ours, through saving grace, To worship in the holy place!
6. 
Thus boldly we now enter in,
Cleansed by Christ's blood from every sin; It speaks for us before Thy throne, Proclaims redemption's work is done.
7. 
Great God, Thy love all love excels; It humbles us, yet praise compels! Eternally our song shall be
Of Him who said, " Remember Me."
1. 

BASKETS full of firstfruits,
Sacrifice of praise�
Songs of our Redeemer
Joyfully we raise.
Lord, we come before Thee
Through the living way, Worshipping with gladness
On this holy day.
2. 
All His deeds of kindness, Every act of grace
Led Him but to Calvary
And the outside place. There we see Him dying,
Bowing to Thy will;
Lamb of Thy providing,
Loving sinners still!
3. 
Bought with blood most precious. Pardoned through His death, Now a holy priesthood
(Thus the scripture saith),
In Thy holy presence
We would humbly dwell; Hearts by Christ redeemed
Songs of praises swell.
4. 
Lord, we only offer
But a thousandth part
Of the love that's owed Thee From each ransomed heart.
Praise we now the Father,
Praise be to the Son
And the Holy Spirit�Praise the Three in One.

1.
WE come with hearts obedient,
Our God, to worship Thee;
The symbols we have taken
In hallowed memOry
Of Christ, Thy well-beloved,
The darling of Thy heart�
At Calvary we see Him
Pierced through with judgment's dart.

3.
Deep shadows crossed His pathway, Yet deeper still to be;
We hear His cry of sorrow
In dark Gethsemane.
For He alone must suffer,
Alone the cup must drain
Of wrath and Thy forsaking,
Our pardon to obtain.



2.
We trace the way appointed
That led to Calvary's hill,
From birth to death obedient
To Thy most holy will. Thyself in Him reflected,
Immanuel, divine;
0 God, what grace and kindness In all His actions shine!
4.
The Lamb of Thy providing
Was on the altar laid;
Our sins were laid upon Him,
And thus our debt was paid.
'Twas love divine that bound Him
In death upon the tree,
And, joined with sovereign mercy, Has set the captives free.

5.
Freed by such love, we ponder
The fulness of His grace,
That brings us in with gladness
Within the holy place.
0 God, our hearts united
Would praise Thee for Thy Son, For all in wondrous kindness
That Thou, through Him, hast done.
Amen.

Thou, ere the worlds were made, didst plan To seek and save poor ruined man.
We cannot praise Thee as we ought. Thy love excels our highest thought!
2. 
Thou didst Thy Son in pity give,
That sinners through His death might live; He suffered on the shameful tree
To rescue us from misery.
We cannot praise Him as we ought,
His love excels our highest thought!
3. 
The Holy Spirit, Teacher blest, Who giiides us to our heavenly rest,
Makes these poor hearts His dwelling place, To whisper there the tale of grace.
We cannot praise Him as we ought, His love excels our highest thought!

When Christ shall bring us in to Thee, We'll praise Thy grace more worthily; With all the blood-bought hosts above We'll magnify Thy boundless love;
We fain would praise Thee as we ought, Thy love excels our highest thought!

We read Thy patience still.

Our souls are filled with awe divine To see what God performs.

For the bright glories of Christ's name

Nor wanting, nor wasting, Thou rulest in might; Thy justice like mountains high soaring above, Thy clouds are as fountains of goodness and love.

We blossom and flourish as leaves on the tree, And wither and perish, but nought changeth Thee.

In human form did take man's place, And God and man in one combine!

SEE mercy, mercy from on high
Descend to rebels doomed to die.
'Tis mercy free which knows no bound, How grand, how gladsome is the sound!
2. 
Soon as the reign of sin began
The light of mercy dawned on man, When God announced the early news, " The woman's Seed thy head shall
[bruise."
3. 
Brightly it beamed on man forlorn, When Christ, the holy Child, was born. And in its fullest splendour shone When Jesus, dying, cried " 'Tis done."
4. 
It triumphed when from death He rose And brake the power of all His foes; And since He took His seat on high Now mercy reigns eternally.

And in this honour none shall share. Who is a pardoning God like Thee, Or who hath grace so rich and free?

Here would we grasp with firmer hands His grace, And all our weariness upon Him lean.

Here would we feed upon the bread of God, Here drink with Him the royal wine of heaven; Here would we lay aside each earthly load, Here taste afresh the calm of sin forgiven.

We have no help but His, nor do we need Another arm save His to lean upon.
It is enough, 0 God, enough indeed,
Our strength is in His might, His might alone.

Ours is the sin, but His the righteousness, Ours is the guilt, but His the cleansing blood. Here is our robe, our refuge, and our peace,
The righteousness He wrought, 0 Lord our God.

The feast, though not the love, is past and gone; The bread and wine remove, but He is here, Nearer than ever, still our Shield and Sun.

The Lamb's great bridal feast of bliss and love.

Amen, one lasting, long Amen�Heaven's blissful cadence, deep and loud, While every heart before the throne
In holy, solemn awe is bowed.
3.
Amen, Amen, it rolls along, Re-echoing from the throne again; Be ours to mingle with the throng In that eternal, loud Amen.
148f RICHMOND
1.
LORD of the worlds above, How pleasant and how fair The dwellings of Thy love, The heavenly mansions are!
To Thine abode
Our hearts aspire With warm desire To see our God.
2.
There is Thy throne of grace, And there the sprinkled blood; There lives before Thy face Our great High Priest, 0 God;
His name our plea,
We now draw near
In holy fear
To worship Thee. 
149 WEBER
1. 
CHRIST has done the mighty work; Nothing left for us to do
But to enter on His toil,
Enter on His triumph too.
2. 
His the pardon, ours the sin�Great the sin, the pardon great; His the good, and ours the ill; His the love, and ours the hate.
3. 
His the labour, ours the rest; His the death, and ours the life; Ours the fruits of victory,
His the agony and strife.
4. 
He has sown the precious seed, Nothing left for us unsown; Ours it is to reap the field, Make the harvest joy our own.

150 PAX DEL
1. 
JEHOVAH God the Father, bless and keep His little flock of feeble lambs and sheep; Jehovah God the Son, His glorious face Make shine on us, so full of kindly grace;
2. 
Jehovah God the Paraclete, uplift
His countenance, and grant us peace, His gift.
Eternal triune God, with love inflame
Our souls, to praise Thy great Jehovah name. Amen, amen.

151 QUAM DILECTA
1. 
ONCE more before we part, We bless the Saviour's name; Let every tongue and heart Join to extol the Lamb.
2. 
We on Thy holy word
Would feed, and live, and grow; Go on to know Thee, Lord, And practise what we know.

152 JACKSONS
1. 
THIS is the day the Lord hath made, He calls the hours His own.
Let heaven rejoice, let earth be glad, And praise surround Thy throne.
2. 
Today He rose and left the dead, And Satan's empire fell;
Today the saints His triumph spread, And all His wonders tell.
3. 
Help us, 0 Lord, on this blest day,
To spread the glad, good news, And may Thy gospel's healing ray
Its saving power diffuse.

3.
Lord, in Thy grace we came; Thy blessing still impart.
We met in Thine own name And in Thy name we part.

4.
Hosanna to th' anointed King,
To God's most holy Son!
With gladsome hearts we now would bring Our praise unto the throne.
Blessed are they that dwell in Thy house,
They will be still praising Thee.
