153 MARCHING TO ZION

1. COME, ye that love the Lord,
And let your joys be known;
Join in a song with sweet accord,
And thus surround the throne.

We're marching to Zion, beautiful, beautiful Zion!
We're marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God.

2. Let those refuse to sing
Who never knew our God;
But children of the heavenly King
Must speak their joys abroad.

3. The hill of Zion yields
A thousand sacred sweets,
Before we reach the heavenly fields 
Or walk the golden streets.

4. Then let our songs abound,
And every tear be dry.
We're marching through this weary land
To fairer worlds on high.


 154 FALCON STREET

1. GRACE! 'tis a charming sound, 
Harmonious to the ear;
Heaven with the echo shall resound,
And all the earth shall hear.

2. Grace first contrived the way 
To save rebellious man,
And all the steps that grace display 
Which drew the wondrous plan.

3.'Twas grace that wrote each name 
In life's eternal book;
'Twas grace that gave us to the Lamb,
Who all our sorrows took.

4. Grace taught our wandering feet
To tread the heavenly road;
And new supplies each hour we meet
While travelling home to God.

5. Grace taught us how to pray, 
And made our eyes o'erflow;
'Tis grace has kept us to this day,
And will not let us go.

6. May grace, free grace, inspire 
Our souls with strength divine;
May all our thoughts to God aspire,
And grace in service shine.

7. Grace all the work shall crown 
Through everlasting days;
It lays in heaven the topmost stone,
And well deserves the praise.

Chorus at the end of the hymn.

Praise ye the Lord, Hallelujah!
Hallelujah! Hallelujah! 
Praise ye the Lord.
Amen.

1. COME, ye that know the Saviour's name, 
And raise your thoughts above;

To sing that God is love.

And all His mercies prove;

With those who from Him rove,

Declares that God is love.

Proclaim that God is love.
 


156 HOWARD

1. WHEN all Thy mercies, blessed God,
Each rising soul surveys, 
Transported with the view, we're lost
In wonder, love and praise.

2. Unnumbered comforts on each soul 
Thy tender care bestowed,
Before our infant hearts conceived 
From whom those comforts flowed.

3. Ten thousand thousand precious gifts 
Our daily thanks employ,
But oh! Thy greatest gift, Thy Son, 
This is our greatest joy.

4. Through all eternity to Thee
A joyful song we'll raise, 
But e'en eternity's too short
To utter all Thy praise.
 


157 PETERBOROUGH

1. THE spacious firmament on high, 
With all the blue ethereal sky,
And spangled heavens, a shining frame, 
Their great Original proclaim.
Th' unwearied sun from day to day 
Does his Creator's power display, 
And publishes to every land
The work of an almighty hand.

2. Soon as the evening shades prevail 
The moon takes up the wondrous tale, 
And nightly to the listening earth 
Repeats the story of her birth;
While all the stars that round her burn, 
And all the planets in their turn, 
Confirm the tidings as they roll,
And spread the truth from pole to pole.

3. What though in solemn silence all 
Move round the dark terrestrial ball? 
What though no real voice or sound 
Amidst their radiant orbs be found? 
In reason's ear they all rejoice
And utter forth a glorious voice; 
For ever singing as they shine, 
"The hand that made us is divine."
 


158 MONKLAND

1 LET us with a gladsome mind 
Praise the Lord, for He is kind; 
For His mercies aye endure, 
Ever faithful, ever sure.

Filled the formless earth with light; 
For His mercies aye endure,
Ever faithful, ever sure. 

3. All things living He doth feed, 
His full hand supplies their need; 
For His mercies aye endure, 
Ever faithful, ever sure.

4. He hath with a piteous eye 
Looked upon our misery; 
For His mercies aye endure, 
Ever faithful, ever sure.
 


159 OMBERSLEY

1. OUR God, we call upon our souls 
And all within us that subsists,
To bless and praise Thy holy name, 
Nor to forget Thy benefits.

2. All our iniquities and sins,
In mercy great Thou hast forgiven, 
And healest, too, diseases all
Of our frail frame by boons from heaven.

3. Our lives are now redeemed by Thee 
From all destruction, and we're crowned 
With loving-kindness full and free,
And tender mercies which abound.

4. Thou also satisfiest well
Our hungry mouths with all good things
So that our youth becomes renewed
Like eagles as they mount on wings.

5. And though we're likened unto grass
Whose flower by wind doth pass away,
Thy loving-kindness endeth not
For fearing ones who heed Thy way.

6. O gracious God, Thy throne's on high, 
Thy kingdom ruleth over all.
We join the great angelic hosts
To bless Thee and before Thee fall.
 


160 ST. CHRYSOSTOM

1. O GOD, whose wondrous name is Love,
Whose hands have fashioned us anew,
Before Thy face is now the Lamb,
Whom sinful man once pierced and slew; 
Thine holy Son Thou didst not spare, 
How canst Thou cease for us to care?

2. Our heavenly Father, grant us all 
The new-born babe's simplicity. 
The doubtful mind be far from us 
Who boast a God that cannot lie. 
Arrayed in comeliness divine,
On Jesus' bosom we recline.

3. Thou art the Potter, we the clay,
Thy will be ours, Thy truth our light; 
Thy love the fountain of our joy,
Thine arm our safeguard day and night, 
Till Thou shalt wipe our tears away, 
And Christ shall bring eternal day.

By earth and heaven confessed; 
We bow, and bless the sacred name, 
For ever blest.

2. The God of Abraham praise,
At whose supreme command
From earth we rise, and seek the joys
At His right hand.

Earth's wisdom, fame, and power;

In all our ways.

We on His oath depend;
We shall on eagles' wings upborne, 
To heaven ascend.
We shall behold His face,
We shall His power adore,
And sing the wonders of His grace, 
For evermore.

5. The whole triumphant host Give thanks to God on high;

They ever cry.

Our God and Abraham's praise,
"Might, majesty to Thee belong,
To endless days."

God is love.
Whilst endless ages roll along,
In concert with the heavenly throng
This shall be still our sweetest song,
God is love.
 


163 HANFORD

1.  WE cannot always trace the way
Where Thou, our gracious Lord, dost move;
But we can always surely say
That Thou art love.

2. When fear its gloomy cloud will fling 
O'er earth; our souls to heaven above. 
As to their sanctuary, spring;
For Thou art love.

We'll check our dread, our doubts remove;

That Thou art love.

165 PRAISE, MY SOUL

1.  PRAISE, my soul, the King of heaven, 
To His feet thy tribute bring;
Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven, 
Who like thee His praise should sing?
Praise Him! Praise Him! 
Praise the everlasting King.

2. Praise Him for His grace and favour 
To our fathers in distress;
Praise Him, still the same for ever, 
Slow to chide and swift to bless.
Praise Him! Praise Him! 
Glorious in His faithfulness.

3. Father-like, He tends and spares us,
Well our feeble frame He knows; 
In His hands He gently bears us,
Rescues us from all our foes.
Praise Him! Praise Him!
Widely as His mercy flows.

4. Angels, evermore adore Him,
Ye behold Him face to face.
Sun and moon, bow down before Him,
Dwellers all in time and space.
Praise Him! Praise Him!
Praise with us the God of grace.
 


166 BALLERMA

1. I WAITED for the Lord my God, 
And patiently did bear;
At length to me He did incline,
My voice and cry to hear.

2. He took me from a fearful pit
And from the miry clay.
And on a rock He set my feet,
Establishing my way.

3. He put a new song in my mouth, 
Our God to magnify;
Many shall see it and shall fear, 
And on the Lord rely.

4. Oh, blessed is the man whose trust 
Upon the Lord relies,
Respecting not the proud, nor such 
As turn aside to lies.

5. O Lord my God, full many are
The wonders Thou hast done;
Thy gracious thoughts to usward far
Above all thoughts are gone.

6. Thy tender mercies, Lord, from me 
Oh, do Thou not restrain;
Thy loving-kindness and Thy truth
Let them me still maintain.
 


167 SHIRLAND

1. GOD everywhere hath sway, 
And all things serve His might;
His every act pure blessing is,
His path unsullied light.

2. He hath made bare His arm. 
Who shall His work withstand'
'Tis He His people's cause defends,
Who then shall stay His hand?

3. We comprehend Him not
Yet earth and heaven tell.
God sits as Sovereign on the throne, 
And ruleth all things well.
 


168 ADORATION

1. COME, Thou fount of every blessing, 
Tune my heart to sing Thy praise; 
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for ceaseless songs of praise.
Teach me, Lord, some rapturous measure,
Meet for blood-bought hosts above,
While I sing the countless treasure
Of my God's unchanging love.

2. Jesus sought me when a stranger, 
Wandering from the fold of God;
He, to rescue me from danger, 
Interposed His precious blood.
Oh, to grace how great a debtor 
Daily I'm constrained to be'
Let that grace, Lord, like a fetter 
Bind my wandering heart to Thee.

3. Prone to wander, Lord, I know it,
Prone to leave the God I love.
Keep my heart from wandering, keep it
Till I'm perfected above.
Here I raise my Ebenezer,
Hither by Thy help I'm come; 
Teach me, Lord, to do Thy pleasure, 
Till I reach my heavenly home.
 


169 PEEL CASTLE

1. IN safety standing on the Red Sea's shore, 
The sons of Israel viewed the closing grave 
Of groaning tyranny and bondage sore,
As Egypt's hosts sank 'neath the surging wave.

2. Long, weary years had Pharaoh's jealous might, 
With unrelenting rigour, crushed them low;
But God Almighty bared His arm in fight,
 And to destruction hurled the haughty foe.

3. Saved now and free! oh, soul-inspiring thought! 
Well might ascend from Israel's ransomed throng 
To Him whose works had their salvation wrought, 
Deep thanks expressed in loud and rapturous song.

4. Ten, tens of thousands sang the matchless fame 
Of their Deliverer in triumphant lays,
Proclaiming far Jehovah's glorious name
As truly worthy of eternal praise.

5. So let us sing, for greater cause have we
Than Israel had to praise the living God.
From earthly tyrant's bonds were they set free—
We groaned in sin, 'neath Satan's despot rod.

6. Let joyous songs from thankful hearts ascend 
To God our Saviour, who, from light above, 
Did in His Son a great Deliverer send,
Who freed us by His work of mighty love.
 


170 DIADEMATA

1. OUR times are in Thy hand. 
O God, we wish them there;
Our lives, our souls, our all, we leave 
Entirely to Thy care.
Our times are in Thy hand, 
Whatever they may be;
Pleasing or 'painful, dark or bright,
As best may seem to Thee.

2. Our times are in Thy hand. 
Why should we doubt or fear?
Our Father's hand will never cause
His child a needless tear.
Our times are in Thy hand, 
Jesus, the Crucified;
The hand our many sins have pierced
Is now our guard and guide.

3. Our times are in Thy hand, 
Jesus, the Advocate.
Nor can that hand be stretched in vain, 
For us to supplicate.
Our times are in Thy hand; 
We'd always trust in Thee,
Till we, in yonder heavenly land, 
Thyself in glory see.
 


171 ST. ANN

1. O GOD, our help in ages past,
Our hope for time to come,
Our shelter from the stormy blast,
And our eternal home 

2. Under the shadow of Thy throne
Thy saints have dwelt secure; 
Sufficient is Thine arm alone,
And our defence is sure. 

3. Before the hills in order stood
Or earth received her frame, 
From everlasting Thou art God,
To endless years the same.

4. Thou turnest human flesh to dust;
"Return, ye sons of men."
All men are made from dust at first,
And turn to dust again.

5. A thousand ages in Thy sight
Are like an evening gone;
Short, as the watch that ends the night 
Before the rising sun.

6. The busy tribes of flesh and blood,
With all their joys and cares, 
Are carried downwards by a flood
And perish unawares.

7. Time, like an ever-rolling stream,
Bears all its sons away;
They fly forgotten, as a dream 
Dies at the opening day.

8. Like flowery fields the nations stand
Pleased with the morning light;
The flowers, beneath the mower's hand,
Lie withering ere 'tis night.

9. O God, our help in ages past,
Our hope for time to come,
Be Thou our guard while life shall last,
And our eternal home. Amen.
 


172 WILTSHIRE

1. O THOU, whose bounty fills our cup
With every blessing meet,
We give Thee thanks for every drop,
The bitter and the sweet.

2. We thank Thee for the desert road, 
And for the riverside;
For all Thy goodness has bestowed.
And all Thy grace denied.

3. We thank Thee for the smile and frown, 
And for the gain and loss;
We bless Thee for the future crown, 
And for the present cross.

4. We bless Thee for the glad increase,
And for the waning joy;
And for the calm and settled peace
That nothing can destroy.
 


173 ORLINGTON

1. Hast thou not known, hast thou not heard, 
That firm remains on high
The e?erlasting throne of Him
Who formed the earth and sky? 

2. Art thou afraid His power shall fail
When comes thine evil day?
And can an all-creating arm
Grow weary or decay?
	
3. Supreme in wisdom as in power
The Rock of ages stands,
Though Him thou canst not see, nor trace 
The working of His hands.
	
4. He gives the conquest to the weak, 
Supports the fainting heart; 
And courage in the evil hour
His heavenly aids impart.

5. Mere human power shall fast decay, 
And youthful vigour cease;
But they who wait upon the Lord
In strength shall still increase.

6. They with unwearied feet shall tread 
The path of life divine,
With growing ardour onward move,
With growing brightness shine.
 


174 OLD 29TH

1. HE sitteth o'er the waterfloods,
And He is strong to save;
He sitteth o'er the waterfloods,
And guides each drifting wave.
Though loud around the vessel's prow
The waves may toss and break,
Yet, at His word, they sink to rest,
As on a tranquil lake.

2. He sitteth o'er the waterfloods,
When waves of sorrow rise;
And while He holds the bitter cup
He wipes the tearful eyes.
He knows how long the wilful heart
Requires the chastening grief,
And soon as sorrow's work is done
'Tis He who sends relief.

3. He sitteth o'er the waterfloods, 
As in the days of old,
When o'er the Saviour's sinless head
The waves and billows rolled.
Yea, all the billows passed o'er Him;
Our sins they bore Him down;
For us He met the crushing storm,
He met th' Almighty's frown.

4. He sitteth o'er the waterfloods,
Then doubt and fear no more;
For He who passed through all the storms
Has reached the heavenly shore. 
And every tempest-driven bark,
With Jesus for its guide,
Will soon be moored in harbour calm,
In glory to abide. Amen. 
 


175 SEBASTIAN

1. SING praise to God who reigns above, 
The God of all creation,
The God of power, the God of love, 
The God of our salvation.
With healing balm our souls He fills, 
And every faithless murmur stills; To God all praise and glory.

2. The angel-hosts, O King of kings,
Thy praise for ever telling,
In earth and sky all living things
Beneath Thy shadow dwelling,
Adore the wisdom which could span, 
And power which formed creation's plan; 
To God all praise and glory.

3. What God's almighty power hath made
His gracious mercy keepeth.
By morning glow or evening shade
His watchful eye ne'er sleepeth. 
Within the kingdom of His might, 
Lo, all is just, and all is right;
To God all praise and glory.

4. O ye who bear Christ's holy name
Give God all power and glory;
All ye who own His power proclaim
And sing the wondrous story. 
Cast each false idol from its throne, 
The Lord is God and He alone;
To God all praise and glory.
 


176 EASTGATE

1. GOD moves in a mysterious way,
His wonders to perform;
He plants His footsteps in the sea,
And rides upon the storm.

2. Deep in unfathomable mines
Of never-failing skill,
He treasures up His bright designs,
And works His sovereign will.

3. Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take;
The clouds ye so much dread
Are big with mercy, and shall break
In blessings on your head.

4. Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
But trust Him for His grace; 
Behind a frowning providence
He hides a smiling face.

5. His purposes will ripen fast, 
Unfolding every hour;
The bud may have a bitter taste, 
But sweet will be the flower.

6. Blind unbelief is sure to err,
And scan His work in vain; 
God is His own interpreter,
And He will make it plain. 
 


177 CASTLE STREET

1. As sinners saved we gladly praise 
The Author of redeeming grace; 
Father, 'tis Thine almighty power 
Secures us when the tempests lower.

2. Thy love's a refuge ever nigh,
Thy watchfulness a mountain high; 
Thy name a rock which winds above 
And waves below can never move.

3. Thy faithfulness for ever sure
For endless ages shall endure;
Thy perfect work shall ever prove 
The depth of Thine unchanging love.

4. While all things change Thou changest not
Forgetting ne'er, though oft forgot ;
 Thy love eternally the same
Is as enduring as Thy name.

5. Lord, we would then rejoice and praise
The source of all this wondrous grace. 
Father, Thine everlasting power
Will keep us safe in danger's hour.
 


178 SOME TIME
 
1. NOT now, but in the coming years, 
It may be in the better land,
We'll read the meaning of our tears, 
And there, some time, we'll understand.

Chorus:
Then trust in God through all thy days; 
Fear not, for He doth hold thy hand; 
Though dark thy way, still sing and praise; 
Some time, some time we'll understand.

2. We'll catch the broken threads again, 
And finish what we here began; 
Heaven will the mysteries explain, 
And then, ah then, we'll understand.

3. We'll know why clouds instead of sun 
Were over many a cherished plan;
Why song has ceased when scarce begun; 
'Tis there, some time, we'll understand.

4. Why what we long for most of all 
Eludes so oft our eager hand,
Why hopes are crushed, and castles fall, 
Up there, some time, we'll understand.

5. God knows the way, He holds the key, 
He guides us with unerring hand. 
Some time with tearless eyes we'll see; 
Yes there, up there, we'll understand.
 


179 SAFE HOME

1. JEHOVAH IS our strength,
And He shall be our song;
We shall o'ercome at length,
Although our foes be strong; 
In vain doth Satan then oppose, 
For God is stronger than His foes.

2. The Lord our refuge is,
And ever will remain;
Since He hath made us His
He will our cause maintain; 
In vain our enemies oppose,
For God is stronger than His foes.

3. The Lord our portion is;
What can we wish for more? 
As long as we are His
We never can be poor;
In vain do earth and hell oppose, 
For God is stronger than His foes.

4. The Lord our Shepherd is, 
He knows our every need; 
And since we now are His, 
His care our souls will feed;
In vain do sin and death oppose,
For God is stronger than His foes.

5. This God our Father is,
Our names are on His heart; 
We ever shall be His,
He ne'er from us will part;
In vain the world and flesh oppose, 
For God is stronger than His foes.
 
 


180 BENTLEY

1. SOMETIMES a light surprises
The Christian while he sings; 
It is the Lord who rises
With healing in His wings. 
When comforts are declining,
He grants the soul again 
A season of clear shining,
To cheer it after rain.

2. In holy contemplation
We gladly then pursue
The theme of God's salvation, 
And find it ever new.
Set free from present sorrow
We cheerfully can say,
E'en let th' unknown tomorrow
Bring with it what it may;

3. It can bring with it nothing
But He will bear us through; 
Who gives the lilies clothing
Will clothe His people too. 
Beneath the spreading heavens
No creature but is fed;
And He who feeds the ravens
Will give His children bread.

4. Though vine or fig-tree neither
Their wonted fruit shall bear; 
Though all the field shall wither,
Nor flocks nor herds be there; 
Yet God the same abiding,
His praise shall tune my voice; 
For while in Him confiding,
I cannot but rejoice.
 


181 MAIN
 
1. THROUGH the love of God Our Saviour
All will be well;
Free and changeless is His favour,
All will be well;
Precious is the blood that healed us,
Perfect is the grace that sealed us,
Strong the hand stretched forth to shield us, 
All will be well.

2. Though we pass through tribulation,
All will be well; 
Ours is such a full salvation,
All, all is well; 
Happy still in God confiding, 
Fruitful if in Christ abiding,
Holy through the Spirit's guiding,
All must be well.

3. We expect a bright tomorrow,
All will be well;
Faith can sing through days of sorrow,
All, all is well;
On our Father's love relying,
He our every need supplying,
Or in living or in dying,
All must be well.



182 HOUGHTON

1. THOUGH troubles assail and dangers affright,
Though friends should all fail and foes all unite; 
Yet one thing secures us, whatever betide—
The Scripture assures us, "The Lord will provide."

2. The birds, without barn or storehouse, are fed;
From them let us learn to trust for our bread. 
His saints what is fitting shall ne'er be denied, 
So long as 'tis written, "The Lord will provide."

3. His call to obey, like Abram of old
Not knowing our way, but faith makes us bold; 
For though we are strangers we have a good guide, 
And trust in all dangers; "The Lord will provide."

4. No strength of our own or goodness we claim;
Yet since we have known the Saviour's great name, 
In this our strong tower for safety we hide,
Almighty His power; "The Lord will provide."
 


183 HOUGHTON

1. BEGONE unbelief, the Saviour is near,
And for my relief will surely appear.
By prayer let me wrestle, and He will perform; 
With Christ in the vessel, I smile at the storm.

2. Though dark be the way, since He is my Guide,
'Tis mine to obey, 'tis His to provide.
Though cisterns be broken and creatures all fail, 
The word He hath spoken shall surely prevail.

3. His love in times past forbids me to think
He'll leave me at last in trouble to sink;
Each sweet Ebenezer I pass in review
Confirms His good pleasure to help me right through.

4. Why should I complain of want or distress,
Temptation or pain? He told me no less.
The heirs of salvation, I know from His word,
Through much tribulation must follow their Lord.

5. How bitter that cup no heart can conceive,
The Saviour drank up, that sinners might live; 
His way was much rougher and darker than mine; 
Did Christ my Lord suffer, and shall I repine?

6. Since all that I meet shall work for my good,
The bitter is sweet, the medicine is food;
Though painful at present 'twill cease before long, 
And then, oh how pleasant the conqueror's song!
 
 


184 HOLY TRINITY

1. I bow me to Thy will, O God,
And all Thy ways adore;
And every day I live I'd seek
To please Thee more and more.

2. Why should I care, O blessed God,
Since all my cares are Thine? 
Why not in triumph live, since Thou
Hast made Thy triumphs mine?

3. Lead on, lead on triumphantly,
O blessed Lord, lead on;
Faith's pilgrim sons behind Thee seek
The road that Thou hast gone.

4. He always wins who sides with God, 
To him no chance is lost;
God's will is sweetest to him when 
It triumphs at his cost.
 
5. Ill that God blesses is our good, 
And unblest good is ill;
And all is right that seems most wrong
If, Lord, it be Thy will. Amen.
 


185 NICOMACHUS

1. GOD of my life, to Thee I call; 
Afflicted, at Thy feet I fall.
When the great waterfloods prevail, 
Leave not my trembling heart to fail.

2. Friend of the friendless and the faint, 
Where should I lodge my deep complaint, 
Where, but with Thee, whose open door 
Invites the helpless and the poor?

3. Did ever mourner plead with Thee, 
And Thou refuse that mourner's plea? 
Does not the word still fixed remain, 
That none shall seek Thy face in vain?

4. That were a grief I could not bear, 
Didst Thou not hear and answer prayer. 
But a prayer-hearing, answering God 
Supports me under every load.

5. Fair is the lot that's cast for me;
I have an Advocate with Thee. 
They whom the world caresses most 
Have no such privilege to boast.

6. Poor though I am, despised, forgot, 
Yet God, my God, forgets me not; 
And he is safe, and must succeed,
For whom the Lord vouchsafes to plead.
 


186 LENOX

1. O BLESSED God, how kind
Are all Thy ways to me,
Whose dark, benighted mind
Was enmity to Thee!
Yet now, subdued by sovereign grace, 
My spirit longs for Thine embrace.

2. How precious are Thy thoughts
That o'er my spirit roll!
They swell beyond my faults
And captivate my soul.
How great their sum, how high they rise, 
Can ne'er be known beneath the skies.

3. Preserved by Jesus, when
My feet made haste to hell, 
And there should I have gone, 
But Thou doest all things well.
Thy love was great, Thy mercy free,
Which from the pit delivered me.

4. Before Thy hands had made
The sun to rule the day,
Or earth's foundation laid,
Or fashioned Adam's clay,
What thoughts of peace and mercy flowed 
In Thy great heart of love, O God!

5. A monument of grace,
A sinner saved by blood,
The streams of love I trace 
Up to the fountain, God;
And in His sovereign counsels see 
Eternal thoughts of love to me.
 


187 FINLANDIA

1.  BE still, my soul, the Lord is on thy side;
Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain. 
Leave to thy God to order and provide; 
In every change He faithful will remain.
Be still, my soul, thy best, thy heavenly Friend 
Through thorny ways leads to a joyful end.

2. Be still, my soul, thy God doth undertake
To guide the future as He has the past.
Thy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake; 
All now mysterious shall be bright at last.
Be still, my soul, the waves and winds still know 
His voice, who ruled them while He dwelt below.

3. Be still, my soul, the hour is hastening on 
When we shall be for ever with the Lord; 
When disappointment, grief and fear are gone, 
Sorrow forgot, love's purest joys restored.
Be still, my soul, when change and tears are past, 
All safe and blessed we shall meet at last.
 

188  HE WILL HIDE ME
 
1. WHEN the storms of life are raging,
Tempests wild on sea and land,
I will seek a place of refuge
In the shadow of God's hand.

He will hide me, He will hide me, 
Where no harm can e'er betide me; 
He will hide me, safely hide me,
In the shadow of His hand.

2. Though He may send some affliction, 
'Twill but make me long for home; 
For in love and not in anger,
All His chastenings will come. 

3. Enemies may strive to injure,
Satan all his arts employ;
God will turn what seems to harm me 
Into everlasting joy.

4. So, while here the cross I'm bearing, 
Meeting storms and billows wild, 
Jesus for my soul is caring,
Nought can harm His Father's child.
 


189 TEMPLE

1. God's almighty arms are round me,
Peace, peace is mine.
Judgment scenes need not confound me,
Peace, peace is mine. 
Jesus came Himself and sought me,
Sold to death, He found and bought me, 
Then my blessed freedom taught me;
Peace, peace is mine.

2. While I hear life's surging billows,
Peace, peace is mine. 
Why suspend my harp on willows?
Peace, peace is mine.
I may sing with Christ beside me 
Though a thousand ills betide me, 
Safely He hath sworn to guide me;
Peace, peace is mine.

3. Every trial draws Him nearer,
Peace, peace is mine.
All His strokes but make Him dearer,
Peace, peace is mine. 
Bless I then the hand that smiteth 
Gently, and to heal delighteth; 
'Tis against my sins He fighteth;
Peace, peace is mine.

4. Welcome, every rising sunlight,
Peace, peace is mine. 
Nearer home each rolling midnight,
Peace, peace is mine. 
Death and hell cannot appal me, 
Safe in Christ whate'er befall me, 
Calmly wait I till He call me;
Peace, peace is mine.
 


190 GOD HOLDS THE KEY

1. GOD holds the key of all unknown,
And I am glad;
If other hands should hold the key, 
Or if He trusted it to me,
I might be sad. 

2. What if tomorrow's cares were here,
Without its rest!
I'd rather He unlock the day,
And, as the hours swing open, say,
"My will is best."

3. The very dimness of my sight 
Makes me secure;
For, groping in my misty way, 
I feel His hand, I hear Him say,
"My help is sure."

4. I cannot read His future plans,
But this I know—
I have the smiling of His face, 
And all the refuge of His grace,
While here below.

5. Enough! this covers all my wants,
And so I rest.
For what I cannot, He can see, 
And in His care I saved shall be, 
For ever blest.
 


191 MEMORIA

1.  MY God, my Father, while I stray 
Far from my home on life's rough way, 
Oh teach me from my heart to say,
"Thy will be done."

2. Though dark my path or sad my lot, 
Let me be still, and murmur not,
But breathe the prayer divinely taught,
"Thy will be done."

3. What though in lonely grief I sigh 
For friends beloved, no longer nigh? 
Submissive still would I reply,
"Thy will be done."

4. If Thou shouldst call me to resign 
What most I prize, it ne'er was mine;
I only yield Thee what is Thine; 
Thy will be done.

5. If but my fainting heart be blest 
With Thy good Spirit for my Guest, 
My God, to Thee I'll leave the rest;
Thy will be done.

6. Renew my will from day to day, 
Blend it with Thine, and take away 
All that now makes it hard to say,
"Thy will be done."

7. And when on earth I breathe no more 
The prayer oft mixed with tears before, 
I'll sing upon a happier shore,
"Thy will be done." Amen.



192 PATIENCE

1. KEPT, safely kept,
My fears away are swept;
In weakness to my God I cling, 
Though foes be strong I calmly sing, 
Kept, safely kept.

2. Kept by His power,
Whatever dangers lower;
The strength of God's almighty arm 
Doth shield my soul from every harm;
Kept by His power.

3. Through simple faith,
Believing what He saith,
Unshaken on my God I lean,
And realise His power unseen, 
But known to faith.

4. Kept all the way,
E'en to salvation's day;
His mighty love ne'er cold shall wax, 
Nor shall His powerful grasp relax,
Through all the way.
 


193 BENEDICTION

1. I WILL never, never leave thee,
I will never thee forsake;
I will guard and save and keep thee 
For My name and mercy's sake. 
Fear no evil,
Only all My counsel take.

2. When the storm is raging round thee,
Call on Me in humble prayer; 
I will fold My arms about thee,
Guard thee with the tenderest care.
In the trial
I will make thy pathway clear.

3. When the sky above is glowing,
And around thee all is bright, 
Pleasure like a river flowing,
All things tending to delight,
I'll be with thee,
I will guide thy steps aright.

4. When thy soul is dark and clouded,
Filled with doubt and grief and care,
Through the mist by which 'tis shrouded
I will make a light appear.
And the banner
Of My love I will uprear.
 


194 ST. DENIO

1. How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord, 
Is laid for your faith in His excellent word!
What more can He say, than to you He hath said, 
You who unto Jesus for refuge have fled?

2."In every condition, in sickness, in health, 
In poverty's vale or abounding in wealth,
At home or abroad, on the land or the sea,
As th' day may demand shall thy strength ever be.

3."Fear not, I am with thee, oh, be not dismayed, 
I, I am thy God, and will still give thee aid;
Will strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand, 
Upheld by My righteous omnipotent hand.

4."When through the deep waters I call thee to go, 
The floods of distress shall not thee overflow; 
For I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless, 
And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress.

5."When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie, 
My grace all-sufficient shall be thy supply;
The flame shall not hurt thee; I only design 
Thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine.

6."E'en down to old age all My people shall prove
 My sovereign, eternal, unchangeable love;
And when hoary hairs shall their temples adorn, 
Like lambs they shall still on My bosom be borne.

7."The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose, 
I will not, I cannot desert to its foes;
That soul, though all hell should endeavour to shake,
 I'll never, no never, no never forsake."
 


195 ANGELS' STORY

1. THE Lord thy God is with thee,
Where'er thy pathway lie, 
In summer's shining hours,
Or 'neath dull winter's sky. 
In all thy joys and blessings
His hand has its full share; 
Whilst oft-times in thy sorrow,
His purposes lie there. 
 
2. The Lord thy God is with thee;
Then bright shall be the dawn 
Of day that bringeth victory,
The fruit of sorrows borne.
And looking o'er thy pathway,
With joy thou then wilt say,
"The Lord my God was with me
Each moment of the day."

 3. The Lord thy God is with thee, 
He seeth every tear;
Thy weight of grief He knoweth,
Thou still to Him art dear.
Thy prayers, e'en though unuttered,
Pent in thine aching heart,
The Lord thy God doth hear them,
And with thee bears a part.

4. The Lord thy God is with thee,
Although thy way seem hard;
 In keeping His commandments
Thine is a sure reward.
Though called to suffer hardship
In fighting for His name,
The Lord thy God is with thee,
His promise still the same.

5. The Lord thy God is with thee,
O saint, do not despair;
His mighty arm is round thee;
Confide in Him thy care.
If e'er thou growest weary
And feel'st how weak thy strength, 
Forget not He is with thee;
Thou must o'ercome at length.
 
 
196 SONG OF THE BRIDE

1. FEAR thou not, for He is with thee;
Be thou not dismayed.
Look to Him, He'll guide and shield thee;
Do not be afraid.
When temptations round thee gather
And thy strength seems small, 
Look above to God, thy Helper; 
Find in Him thine all.
 
2. He has promised to be with thee,
Hold thee by thy hand;
Why not then go forth with courage
At thy Lord's command? 
Knowing that the way He leadeth
Must be always best,
Fear thou not, and do not falter;
On His promise rest.

3. Cast on Him thine every burden,
Whatsoe'er it be;
Hear His voice unto thee saying,
"Cast thy care on Me."
He has said, "I'll never leave thee,
Never thee forsake;"
Cast then all thy care upon Him,
And fresh courage take.


 
197 ONLY WAITING

1. "ABBA, Father," Lord, we call Thee,
Hallowed name from day to day.
'Tis Thy children's right to know Thee,
None but children "Abba" say. 
This high glory we inherit,
Thy free gift through Jesus' blood; 
God the Spirit with our spirit
Witnesseth we're sons of God.

2. Though our nature's fall in Adam
Shut us wholly out from God,
Thus it was His counsel brought us
Nearer still through Jesus' blood. 
For in Him we found redemption,
Grace, and glory in the Son.
Oh, the height and depth of mercy,
Christ and we through grace are one!

3. Richest stores of heavenly blessings
God hath given through Christ, 
His Son With the Holy Spirit's power
Safe to lead His children on.
Abba, Father, makes all certain,
Both by word and oath and blood; 
Abba saith, 'They are My people,"
And they say, "He is our God."

4. Hence through all the changing seasons,
Trouble, sorrow, sickness, woe,
Nothing changeth God's affections,
Abba's love shall bring us through. 
Soon shall all the blood-bought children
Round the throne their anthems raise
And in songs of rich salvation
Shout to Abba endless praise. 
 


198 DEERHURST

1. ABBA, Father, we approach Thee
In our Saviour's precious name; 
We Thy children, here assembling,
Now Thy promised blessing claim.
From our sins His blood has freed us,
'Tis through Him we now draw nigh; 
And Thy Spirit, too, has taught us,
" Abba, Father," thus to cry.

2. Once as prodigals we wandered
In our folly far from Thee;
But Thy grace o'er sin abounding 
Rescued us from misery.
Thou Thy prodigals hast pardoned,
Kissed us with a father's love,
Killed the fatted calf, and called us
E'er to dwell with Thee above.

3. Clothed in garments of salvation,
Given the children's favoured place, 
We rejoice and Thou rejoicest
In the riches of Thy grace.
Abba, Father, all adore Thee,
All rejoice in heaven above,
While in us they learn the wonders
Of Thy wisdom, power and love.

4. Soon before Thy throne assembled, 
All Thy children shall proclaim¬
"Glory, everlasting glory
Be to God and to the Lamb." 
Abba, then we'll cry, exulting, 
In that holy, happy place,
Thine eternal love beholding,
Mirrored in the Saviour's face.
 


199 NOMEN DOMINI

1. GOD the Unsearchable, mighty and great,
Thou, who the heavens and the earth didst create, 
Known to the Hebrews as true Elohim, 
Worshipped, adored by six-winged seraphim; 
Christ bore our sins when He died on the tree, 
Bringing us nigh by His death unto Thee.

2. Timeless and endless, th'eternal I AM, 
Infinite, holy; Jehovah Thy name; 
Glorious name of th'Ineffable Three, 
Changeless Jehovah we bow before Thee. 
Father and Spirit and Son evermore, 
Triune Jehovah we humbly adore.

3. Rich, all possessing, our Lord, Adonai,
Owner of earth and of sea and of sky,
Ever and ever Thy name be adored,
Wealthy possessor of all things, our Lord. 
Christ, who redeemed us from sin and the Fall, 
Taught us the Lord as our Father to call.

4. Jah is Thy wondrous, mysterious name; 
By it we hail Thee, Thy glory acclaim.
Jah is Thy name, O Thou Ancient of days, 
Solemnly sing we Thine infinite praise. 
Glorious the knowledge of fatherly love 
Brought to our hearts by the heavenly Dove.

5. El, Thou Almighty, Thou powerful and strong, 
(Strength for Thy people the whole way along); 
Humbly we bow and acknowledge Thy claim, 
Mighty unsearchable God is Thy name.
Christ, who redeemed us from sin and the Fall, 
Taught us this God as our Father to call.
 


200 BEHOLD, WHAT LOVE

1. BEHOLD what love, what boundless love, 
The Father hath bestowed
On sinners lost, that we should be
Now called the sons of God!

Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us,
That we should be called the sons of God!

2. No longer far from Him, but now
By precious blood made nigh,
Accepted in the Well-beloved, 
Near to God's heart we lie.

3. What we in glory soon shall be, 
It doth not yet appear;
But when our blessed Lord we see, 
We shall His image bear.

4. With such a blessed hope in view, 
We would more holy be,
More like our risen, glorious Lord
Whose face we shall soon see.
 


201 GREAT IS THY FAITHFULNESS

1.  GREAT is Thy faithfulness, O God my Father,
There is no shadow of turning with Thee;
Thou changest not; Thy compassions, they fail not;
As Thou hast been Thou for ever wilt be.

Great is Thy faithfulness! Great is Thy faithfulness! 
Morning by morning new mercies I see.
All I have needed Thy hand hath provided; 
Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me!

2. Summer and winter and springtime and harvest,
Sun, moon and stars in their courses above, 
Join with all Nature in manifold witness
To Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.

3. Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth,
Thine own dear presence to cheer and to guide;
Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow,
Blessings all mine, with ten thousand beside!
 
 


202 ELLERS

1.  TRUST not in man, the arm of flesh will fail; 
Trust not in man, his strength cannot avail; 
Trust not in man, though great may be his boast; 
Trust not in man—who trusts in him is lost.

2. Trust thou in God, though all around deride; 
Trust thou in God when good or ill betide;
Trust thou in God, though strongest men may fall; 
Trust thou in God, make Him thy all in all.

3. Trust thou in God in dark and stormy days; 
Trust thou in God in smooth and pleasant ways; 
Trust thou in God, for Satan aye is near;
Trust thou in God, and then thou need'st not fear.

4. Trust thou in God, He is a rock, a tower;
Trust thou in God, thy stronghold is His power; 
Trust thou in God, His promises are sure;
Trust thou in God, in Him thou art secure.

5. Trust thou in God, in secret to Him pray,
Trust thou in God, He'll be thy strength and stay; 
Trust thou in God, make Him thy dearest friend, 
Trust thou in God, He'll keep thee to the end.
 


Section 10. Our Lord Jesus Christ

203 ATHERTON

1. AND did the Holy and the Just,
The Sovereign of the skies,
Stoop down to man's estate and dust,
That guilty worms might rise?

2. Yes, the Redeemer left the throne,
The radiant throne on high,
(Surprising mercy, love unknown)
To suffer, bleed and die.

3. He took the rebel sinner's place,
And suffered in his stead;
For man, oh, miracle of grace!
For sinful man He bled.

4. What heavenly truths and wonders dwell 
In that atoning blood!
By this are sinners saved from hell, 
And reconciled to God.
 
204 
 WHO IS HE?

1. WHO is He in yonder stall,
At whose feet the shepherds fall?

'Tis the Lord, oh wondrous story! 
'Tis the Lord, the King of glory! 
At His feet we humbly fall,
Laud Him, own Him Lord of all.
 
2. Who is He in deep distress, 
Fasting in the wilderness?

3. Who is He the people bless 
For His words of gentleness?

4. Who is He to whom they bring 
All the sick and sorrowing?

5. Who is He who stands and weeps 
At the grave where Lazarus sleeps?

6. Who is He the gathering throng 
Greet with loud triumphant song?

7. Lo at midnight, who is He 
Prays in dark Gethsemane?

8. Who is He on yonder tree 
Dies in grief and agony?

9. Who is He who from the grave 
Rises glorious, strong to save?

10. Who is He who on the throne 
Sits till all His sway shall own?

205 EXULTATE

1. REJOICE and be glad!
The Redeemer hath come! 
Go, look on His cradle, His cross and His tomb.

Sound His praises, tell the story
Of Him who was slain.
Sound His praises, tell with gladness, 
He liveth again!

2. Rejoice and be glad! 
It is sunshine at last!
The clouds have departed, 
The shadows are past.

3. Rejoice and be glad!
For the blood hath been shed; 
Redemption is finished,
The price hath been paid.

4. Rejoice and be glad! 
Now the pardon is free! 
The Just for the unjust 
Hath died on the tree.

5. Rejoice and be glad!
For the Lamb who was slain 
O'er death is triumphant, 
And liveth again.

6. Rejoice and be glad!
For the Lord is on high; 
Christ pleadeth for us
On God's throne in the sky.

7. Rejoice and be glad! 
For He cometh again;
 He cometh in glory, 
The Lamb who was slain.
 
Sound His praises, tell the story
Of Him who was slain.
Sound His praises, tell with gladness, 
He cometh again!
 


206 SONG OF THE BRIDE

1.  GENTLENESS and tender feeling, 
Pity too and grace,
Softly lustred all Thy dealing
With our stricken race.
Thou with sympathy and healing
Mid our woes didst move, 
Every gracious deed revealing
Thou, O Lord, art love.

2. E'en when in Thy poignant anguish, 
Dying on the tree,
When men left Thee there to languish, 
Full of hate to Thee,
When our sins and judgment bearing, 
Smitten from above,
Every cry was then declaring,
Thou, O Lord, art love.

3. Seated in triumphant glory
On the Father's throne,
Still we read the self-same story
That on earth was known; 
Changeless in Thy holy dwelling
Thou dost ever prove;
There Thy wound-prints aye are telling
Thou, O Lord, art love. 

4. Thou, Lord, in Thy heart's affection
Pleadest for us there;
Knowing well our imperfection,
Thou our woes canst share;
Thou canst succour in temptation,
Strengthen from above,
Comfort give and consolation;
Thou, O Lord, art love.

5. Payment meet for all we owe Thee,
We, O Lord, have none;
But we long still more to know Thee
Who our hearts hast won.
May we here, Thy love compelling,
Ever grateful prove;
Walk and word and action telling,
Thou, O Lord, art love.

6. Soon, enraptured we shall meet Thee; 
Thou for us wilt come;
Face to face with joy we'll greet Thee
In that heavenly home.
There, where angel-throngs are praising, 
We with Thee shall move,
This eternal anthem raising, 
Thou, O Lord, art love.
 


207 SAWLEY

1. O LORD, when we the path retrace
Which Thou on earth hast trod,
To man Thy wondrous love and grace,
Thy faithfulness to God;

2. Thy love to man, so sorely tried,
Proved stronger than the grave;
The very spear that pierced Thy side
Drew forth the blood to save;

3. Faithful amidst unfaithfulness,
'Midst darkness only light,
Thou didst Thy Father's name confess, 
And in His will delight,

4. Unmoved by Satan's subtle wiles,
By suffering, shame and loss;
Thy path, uncheered by earthly smiles, 
Led only to the cross;

5. O Lord, with sorrow and with shame, 
We meekly would confess
How little we, who bear Thy name, 
Thy mind, Thy will express.

6. Give us Thy meek, Thy lowly mind; 
We would obedient be,
And all our rest and pleasure find 
In fellowship with Thee.



208 SAWLEY

1. WHAT grace, O Lord, and beauty shone 
Around Thy steps below!
What patient love was seen in all
Thy life and death of woe!

2. For ever on Thy burdened heart
A weight of sorrow hung;
Yet no ungentle, murmuring word 
Escaped Thy silent tongue.

3. Thy foes might hate, despise, revile,
Thy friends unfaithful prove;
Unwearied in forgiveness still,
Thy heart could only love.

4. Oh, give us hearts to love like Thee,
Like Thee, O Lord, to grieve
Far more for others' sins, than all
The wrongs that we receive.

5. One with Thyself, may every eye 
In us, Thy brethren, see
That gentleness and grace that spring
From union, Lord, with Thee.



209 PEACE! BE STILL!

1. MASTER, the tempest is raging,
The billows are tossing high,
The sky is o'ershadowed with blackness,
No shelter or help is nigh.
Carest Thou not that we perish?
How canst Thou lie asleep,
When each moment so madly is threatening
A grave in the angry deep?

The winds and the waves shall obey My will, 
Peace, be still!
Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea, 
Or demons, or men, or whatever it be,
No waters can swallow the ship where lies 
The Master of ocean, and earth, and skies; 
They all shall sweetly obey My will,
Peace, be still!

2. Master, the terror is over,
The elements sweetly rest.
In calmness the lake now reposes,
And peacefulness fills each breast. 
Master, almighty Peacegiver,
Speak to the sin-tossed soul
Who cries to Thee, "Save, or I perish," 
Deliver and take control.
 


210  STRENGTH AND STAY

1. PROPITIOUS seemed the gentle waters laving
Gennes'ret's shore when first the little band,
All thought for coming storm and danger waiving,
Set forth to cross it at their Lord's command.

2. But soon the scene in tempest darkness merges,
The water rages, torn by shrieking winds;
Faith staggers with the boat, and upmost surges
O'erwhelming fear within the tremblers' minds.

3. "Dost Thou not care, O Master, that we perish,
Who at Thy word embarked upon this sea? 
Canst Thou at such a moment slumber cherish,
Indifferent, though we die because of Thee?"

4. Calm and majestic rises from His pillow
Sea's mighty Lord, commanding, "Peace, be still!" 
Sink then to rest, with troubled wind and billow, 
Their tossing minds, soothed by His potent will.

5. Disciples all! The Lord Himself has set us
The course by which we voyage to our home; 
Here lies our confidence whate'er beset us,
We sail with One whose power must overcome.

6. 'Tis easy when o'er stilly waters gliding,
In peaceful faith upon the Lord to rest;
But when our bark on troublous waves is riding,
Will faith triumphant issue through the test?

7. Calm mid surrounding turmoil, mighty Master,
Teach us to rest secure beneath Thy wing;
Thine arm will guard Thy weak ones from disaster,
And safely to their longed-for haven bring.
 


211 GIESSEN

1. RIDE on, ride on, in majesty;
Hark! all the tribes " Hosanna " cry. 
O Saviour meek, pursue Thy road 
With palms and scattered garments strewed.

Ride on, ride on, in majesty, 
In lowly pomp ride on to die.

2. Ride on, ride on, in majesty;
The angel armies of the sky
Look down with sad and wondering eyes, 
To see th'approaching sacrifice.

3. Ride on, ride on, in majesty;
The last and fiercest strife is nigh; 
The Father on His sapphire throne 
Awaits His own anointed Son.

4. Ride on, ride on, in majesty,
In lowly pomp ride on to die;
Bow Thy meek head to mortal pain, 
Then take, O God, Thy power, and reign.
 


212 GOLGOTHA

1. BEHOLD, behold the Lamb of God,
On the cross.
For us He shed His precious blood,
On the cross.
Oh, hear His awful, anguished cry, 
"Eli, lama sabachthani;"
Draw near and see the Saviour die
On the cross. 

2. Behold His arms extended wide,
On the cross.
Behold His bleeding hands and side,
On the cross.
The sun withholds its rays of light, 
The heavens are clothed in shades of
night,
While Jesus fights the dreadful fight
On the cross.

3. By faith we see Him lifted up,
On the cross.
He drinks for us the bitter cup,
On the cross.
The rocks are rent, the mountains quake, 
While Jesus doth atonement make,
While Jesus suffers for our sake
On the cross.

4. And now the mighty deed is done,
On the cross.
The battle's fought, the victory won,
On the cross.
To heaven He turns His holy eyes,
" 'Tis finished," now the Conqueror cries, 
Then bows His sacred head and dies
On the cross.

5. Whereer I go, I'll tell the story
Of the cross.
In nothing else my soul shall glory,
Save the cross.
Yes, this my constant theme shall be, 
Through time and in eternity—
How Jesus conquered death for me
On the cross.
 
213 AUSTRIA

1. SWEET the moments, rich in blessing,
Which before the cross we spend,
Life and health and peace possessing,
From the sinner's dying Friend. 
Here we rest, in wonder viewing
All our sins on Jesus laid,
And a full redemption flowing
From the sacrifice He made.

2. Truly blessed is the station,
Low before the cross to lie, 
And behold the great salvation
To rebellious man brought nigh.
Here we find the dawn of heaven,
While upon the cross we gaze, 
See our trespasses forgiven,
And our songs of triumph raise.

3. Oh that near the cross abiding
We may to the Saviour cleave, 
Nought from Him our hearts dividing,
All for Him content to leave.
May we still, the cross discerning,
There for peace and comfort go, 
There new wonders daily learning,
All the depths of mercy know.
 


214 HORSLEY

1. THERE is a green hill far away,
Outside a city wall,
Where Christ the Lord was crucified,
Who died to save us all.

2. We do not know, we cannot tell
The pains He had to bear; 
But this we know, it was for us
He bled and suffered there. 

3. He died that we might be forgiven,
That we so void of good
Might ever be with Him in heaven, 
Saved by His precious blood.

4. There was no other good enough
To pay the price of sin;
He only could unlock the gate
Of heaven, to let us in.

5. Oh dearly, dearly has He loved!
Shall we not love Him too,
Who trust in His redeeming blood,
And seek His will to do?
 


215 STRACATHRO

1. ALAS, and did my Saviour bleed,
And did my Sovereign die?
Did He devote that sacred head
For such a worm as I?

2. Was it for sins that I had done
He groaned upon the tree? 
Amazing pity, grace unknown,
And love beyond degree!

3. Well might the sun in darkness hide, 
And shut its glories in,
When the incarnate Maker died
For man, His creature's sin.

4. Thus might I hide my blushing face
While Calvary's cross appears;
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness,
And melt mine eyes to tears.

5. But drops of grief can ne'er repay 
The debt of love I owe;
Fain would I give myself away; 
'Tis all that 1 can do.
 


216 PASSION CHORALE

1. O SACRED Head once wounded,
With grief and pain weighed down, 
How scornfully surrounded
With thorns, Thine only crown! 
How art Thou pale with anguish,
With sore abuse and scorn!
How does that visage languish,
Which once was bright as morn!

2. O sacred Head, what glory,
What bliss till now was Thine! 
Yet, though despised and gory,
I joy to call Thee mine.
Thy grief and Thy compassion
Were all for sinners' gain;
Mine, mine was the transgression,
But Thine the deadly pain.

3. What language shall I borrow,
To praise Thee, heavenly Friend, 
For this Thy dying sorrow,
Thy pity without end?
Lord, I am Thine for ever,
Ne'er let me faithless prove; 
Oh, let me never, never,
Forget such dying love! Amen.
 


217 ST. VALENTINE

1. To Calvary, Lord, in spirit oft
Our weary souls repair,
To dwell upon Christ's dying love,
And taste its sweetness there.
 
2. Sweet resting place of every heart
That feels the plague of sin,
Yet knows that deep mysterious joy, 
The peace of God within.

3. There, through that hour of deepest woe, 
His suffering spirit passed;
Grace there its wondrous victory gained, 
And love endured its last.

4. Dear suffering Lamb! His grievous wounds
Have drawn, with cords of love,
Our willing hearts to Him, and linked 
Our life with His above.

5. His sympathies and hopes are ours; 
O God, we wait to see
Creation all, below, above,
By Him redeemed and free.

6. Our longing eyes would fain behold
That bright and blessed brow,
Once wrung with bitterest anguish, wear 
Its crown of glory now.

7. Why linger then? Come, Saviour come, 
Responsive to our call;
Come, claim Thy rightful power and reign 
The Heir and Lord of all.
 


218 HE DIES!

1. HE dies! He dies! the lowly Man of Sorrows, 
On whom were laid our many griefs and woes; 
Our sins He bore beneath God's awful billows, 
And He hath triumphed over all our foes.

I am He that liveth, that liveth and was dead;
I am He that liveth, that liveth and was dead;
And behold! I am alive for evermore,
Behold! I am alive for evermore.
I am He that liveth, that liveth and was dead; 
And behold! I am alive for evermore.

2. He lives! He lives! what glorious consolation! 
Exalted at His Father's own right hand
He pleads for us, and by His intercession 
Enables all His saints by grace to stand.

3. He comes! He comes! Oh, blest anticipation! 
In keeping with His true and faithful word, 
To call us to our heavenly consummation—
Caught up, to be for ever with the Lord.
 


219 ALLHALLOWS

1. WHAT sacred fountain yonder springs
Out from God's throne above,
And all our covenant blessing brings?
'Tis God's unbounded love.

2. What mighty sum paid all my debt
When charged with guilt I stood, 
And hath my soul at freedom set?
'Tis Jesus' precious blood.

3. What stream of light doth now dispel 
My terror of the rod?
Forth from the cross my fears to quell
Shines bright the love of God.

4. What voice is that which speaks for me
In heaven's high court for good,
And from the curse hath set me free?
'Tis Jesus' precious blood.

5. What themes will fill our hearts above 
When praise we sing to God?
His own surpassing boundless love 
And Jesus' precious blood.
 


220 SWABIA

1. CHRIST'S grave is vacant now,
Left for the throne above;
His cross asserts God's right to bless
In His own boundless love.

2.'Twas there the blood was shed,
'Twas there the life was poured;
There Mercy gained her diadem, 
While Justice sheathed her sword.

3. And thence the child of faith 
Sees judgment all gone by,
Perceives the sentence fully met,
"The soul that sins shall die;"

4. Learns how that God in love
Gave Christ, the sins to bear
Of all who own His lordship now, 
That they His place may share;

5. And cries with wondering joy, 
"As He is, so am I—
Pure, holy, loved as Christ Himself;
Who shall my peace destroy?

6. "Reach my blest Saviour first,
Take Him from God's esteem;
Prove Jesus bears one spot of sin, 
Then tell me I'm unclean.

7. "Nay, for He purged my guilt
With His own precious blood;
And such its virtue, not a stain 
E'er meets the eye of God."
 


221 MARYTON

1. HE lives, the great Redeemer lives 
(What joy the blest assurance gives!) 
And now before His Father, God, 
Pleads the full merit of His blood.

2. Great Advocate, almighty Friend, 
On Him do all our hopes depend; 
Our cause can never, never fail, 
For He doth plead, and must prevail.

3. In every dark, distressing hour,
When sin and Satan join their power, 
Let this blest truth repel each dart—
That Christ doth bear us on His heart.
 


222 ARNOLD

1. IN heaven, before God's holy face, 
Behold an Advocate
Who intercedes for us in grace,
With power divinely great.

2. He loves us deeply, this we know 
By tokens that He wears;
Pierced hands and feet and side, all show 
The matchless love He bears.

3. He died to ransom us from sin, 
He lives to save us still
From every power without, within, 
That seeks to work us ill.

4. He, touched with trials that attend
The weakness of our frame, 
Can sympathetic succour lend,
For He has known the same.

5. He overcame His mightiest foe,
When He earth's pathway trod; 
And victory we may also know,
Who come through Him to God.

6. Fear not to come, if sin o'ertake, 
Confessing all to God,
Who will forgive us for His sake,
And cleanse us by His blood.

7. Christ will fresh strength for conflict give, 
The needed grace impart,
That each below for Him may live, 
And He live in each heart.
 


223 ST. AGNES, DURHAM

1. WITH joy we meditate the grace
Of our High Priest above;
His heart is filled with tenderness,
His very name is Love.

2. Touched with a sympathy within,
He knows our feeble frame;
He knows what sore temptations are,
For He has felt the same.

3. But spotless, undefiled and pure,
Our great Redeemer stood;
While Satan's fiery darts He bore,
And did resist to blood.

4. He in the days of lowly flesh
Poured out His cries and tears; 
And, though exalted, feels afresh
What every member bears.

5. Then boldly let our faith address
His mercy and His power;
We shall obtain delivering grace
In each distressing hour.
 


224 TRURO

1. THE Saviour lives, no more to die;
He lives, our Head, enthroned on high; 
He lives triumphant o'er the grave;
He lives eternally to save.

2. He lives to still His people's fears; 
He lives to wipe away their tears; 
He lives their mansions to prepare; 
He lives to bring them safely there.

3. Then let our souls in Him rejoice,
And sing His praise with cheerful voice; 
Our doubts and fears for ever gone, 
For Christ is on the Father's throne.

4. The chief of sinners He receives;
His saints He loves and never leaves; 
He'll guard us safe from every ill, 
And all His promises fulfil.

5. Abundant grace He will afford
Till we are present with the Lord, 
And prove what we have sung before, 
Christ Jesus lives for evermore.
 


225 DUKE STREET

1. WHERE high the heavenly temple stands, 
The house of God not made with hands, 
A great High Priest true manhood wears, 
And there before our God appears.

2. He, who for us as surety stood,
Yielding on earth His precious blood, 
Pursues in heaven His gracious plan, 
The Saviour and the Friend of man.

3. Partaker of the human name,
He knows the frailty of our frame,
 And still remembers in the skies 
His tears and griefs and agonies.

4. In every pang that rends the heart 
The Man of Sorrows bears a part; 
He knows and feels our every grief, 
And gives the suffering saint relief.

5. With boldness therefore at the throne 
Let us make all our sorrows known,
 And seek the aid of heavenly power 
To help us in each trying hour.
 


226 SILVER HILL

1. BEFORE the throne of God above
I have a strong, a perfect plea—
A great High Priest, whose name is Love, 
Who ever lives and pleads for me.

2. My name is graven on His hands; 
My name is written on His heart;
I know that while in heaven He stands, 
No tongue can bid me hence depart.

3. When Satan tempts me to despair 
And tells me of the guilt within, 
Upward I look and see Him there 
Who made an end of all my sin.

4. Because the sinless Saviour died
My sinful soul is counted free, 
For God, the Just, is satisfied 
To look on Him and pardon me.

5. Behold Him there, the risen Lamb, 
My perfect, spotless righteousness; 
The great unchangeable I AM, 
The King of glory and of grace.

6. One with Himself, I cannot die;
My soul is purchased with His blood; 
My life is hid with Christ on high, 
With Christ my Saviour, and my God.
 


227 ST. WINIFRED

1. LAMB of God, Thou now art seated
High upon Thy Father's throne, 
All Thy gracious work completed,
All Thy mighty victory won.
Every knee in heaven is bending
To the Lamb for sinners slain; 
Every voice and harp is swelling,
"Worthy is the Lamb to reign."

2. Lord, in all Thy power and glory,
Still Thy thoughts and eyes are here, 
Watching o'er Thy ransomed people,
To Thy gracious heart so dear;
Thou for us art interceding
(Everlasting is Thy love),
And a blessed rest preparing
In our Father's house above. 

3. Lamb of God, Thou soon in glory
Wilt to this sad earth return;
All Thy foes shall quake before Thee, 
All that now despise Thee, mourn.
Then Thy saints appearing with Thee,
With Thee in Thy kingdom reign;
Thine the praise and Thine the glory, 
Lamb of God for sinners slain! Amen.
 


228 WARWICK

1. O GOD, 'tis joy to look above 
And see Christ on Thy throne;
To search the heights and depths of love 
Which He to us has shown;

2. To look beyond the long dark night 
And hail the coming day,
When He to all the saints in light 
His glories will display.

3. And oh, 'tis joy the path to trace 
By Him so meekly trod;
Learning of Him to walk in grace, 
In fellowship with God.

4. Joy to confess His blessed name.
The virtues of His blood;
And to the weary heart proclaim,
"Behold the Lamb of God."
 


229 JAZER

1. O BLEST Lord Jesus, who but Thou 
On earth, in heaven above,
May claim from all our willing hearts, 
The full response of love?

2. We love Thy brethren, Lord, 'tis true, 
Because in them we see
Sweet traces of Thy blessed self, 
As here they walk with Thee.

3. But oh! Thou loving One, 'twas Thine, 
Thine only, Lord, to part
With life, and all that love could give,
To win the wandering heart.

4. Thus, heirs of endless bliss with Thee, 
We love Thee and adore.
And ask Thee, Lord, that we may learn 
To love Thee more and more.
 


230 LYNTON

1. O Blessed Saviour, is Thy love
So vast, so full, so free?
Fain would we give our hearts, our minds, 
Our lives, our all, to Thee.

2. We love Thee for the glorious worth 
Which in Thyself we see;
We love Thee for the shameful cross, 
Endured so patiently.

3. No man of greater love can boast 
Than for his friend to die;
Thou for Thine enemies wast slain;
What love with Thine can vie?

4. Though in the very form of God, 
With heavenly glory crowned,
Thou didst partake of blood and flesh, 
Beset with sorrows round.

5. Thou wouldst like sinful man be made, 
In everything but sin,
That we as like Thee might become, 
As we unlike have been;

6. Like Thee in faith, in meekness, love,
In every heavenly grace; 
From glory unto glory changed 
Till we behold Thy face.

7. O Lord, we treasure in our hearts 
The memory of Thy love;
And ever may Thy name to us
A grateful odour prove. Amen.


231 OTTERBOURNE

1. THY dying love, O Lord, I own, 
A love unfathomed and unknown; 
All other love can measured be, 
But not Thy boundless love to me.

2. Oh, wonder to myself I am,
That I can view the dying Lamb, 
Can scan the wondrous mystery o'er,
And not be moved to love Him more!

3.'Tis well indeed that 'twas His love,
Not mine, that brought Him from above; 
And well that 'twas His bitter grief,
Not mine, that gave my soul relief.

4. Oh, I am weary of my love,
That doth so little towards Him move! 
Yet do I constant, inly groan
To know the depths of all His own.
 
5. Loved and for ever on the throne, 
Adored and loved, the timeless One 
Will through one long eternal day 
The height and depth of all display.
 
6. Whilst here below meanwhile I'd be
 Content to have Him near to me; 
To know but this, His love alone,
And count my love too mean to own.
 


232 SWEET IS THE PROMISE

1. SWEET is the promise, "I will not forget thee;" 
Nothing can molest or turn my soul away.
E'en though the night be dark within the valley, 
Just beyond is shining an eternal day.

"I will not forget thee or leave thee;
In My hands I'll hold thee, in My arms I'll fold thee; 
I will not forget thee or leave thee 
I am thy Redeemer, I will care for thee."

2. How can I show my gratitude to Jesus
For His love unfailing and His tender care? 
I will proclaim to others His salvation,
That they may accept Him and His promise share.

3. Trusting the promise, "I will not forget thee," 
Onward will I go with songs of joy and praise.
Though earth despise me, though my friends forsake me, 
Jesus will be near me, gladdening my days.

4. When at the golden portals I am standing, 
All my tribulations, all my sorrows past,
How sweet to hear the blessed proclamation 
"Enter faithful servant, welcome home at last!"
 


233 WORSHIP

1."JESUS," that name we love,
Jesus our Lord; "Jesus," all names above,
Jesus the Lord.
Thou, Lord, our all must be, 
Nothing that's good have we, 
Nothing apart from Thee,
Jesus our Lord.

2. As Son of Man it was,
Jesus the Lord,
Thou gav'st Thy life for us,
Jesus our Lord. 
Great was indeed Thy love, 
All other love above,
Love Thou didst dearly prove,
Jesus our Lord.

3. Righteous alone in Thee,
Jesus our Lord; Thou wilt a refuge be,
Jesus the Lord.
Whom then have we to fear,
What trouble, grief or care, 
Since Thou art ever near,
Jesus our Lord?

4. Soon Thou wilt come again,
Jesus the Lord; 
We shall be happy then,
Jesus our Lord;
When Thine own face we see,
Then we shall like Thee be, 
Then evermore with Thee,
Jesus our Lord. 

 


234 PRYSGOL

1. LORD Jesus Christ, our Saviour, 
We only look to Thee;
'Tis in Thy love and favour
Our souls find liberty.
Whilst Satan fiercely rages
And shipwreck oft we fear, 
'Tis this our grief assuages,
That Thou art always near.

2. Yea, though the tempest round us 
Seems safety to defy,
Though rocks and shoals surround us,
And swell the billows high,
Thou dost through all protect us
And cheer us by Thy love; 
Thy counsels too direct us.
Safe to the rest above.

3. There with what joy reviewing
Past conflicts, dangers, fears, 
Thy hand our foes subduing,
And drying all our tears;
Our hearts with rapture burning,
The path we shall retrace,
Where now our souls are learning
The riches of Thy grace.

4. Oh, then how loud the chorus
Shall to Thy name resound, 
From all at rest before us,
From all Thy grace hath found! 
One joyful song for ever
Each heart, each lip, shall raise—
The praise of our Redeemer,
Our God and Saviour's praise!
 


235 LYMINGTON

1. O LORD, who now art seated 
Above the heavens on high, 
The gracious work completed,
For which Thou cam'st to die, 
To Thee our hearts are lifted,
While pilgrims wandering here, 
For Thou alone art gifted
Our every weight to bear.

2. We know that Thou hast bought us
And cleansed us by Thy blood;
We know Thy grace has brought us
As kings and priests to God:
We know that soon the morning
Long looked for hasteth near, 
When we, at Thy returning,
In glory shall appear.

3. O Lord, Thy love's unbounded, 
So full, so vast, so free!
Our thoughts are all confounded
Whene'er we think of Thee.
For us Thou cam'st from heaven, 
For us to bleed and die:
That, purchased and forgiven,
We might ascend on high.

4. Oh, let this love constrain us
To give our hearts to Thee;
Let nothing henceforth pain us 
But that which paineth Thee; 
Our joy, our one endeavour,
Through suffering, conflict, shame, 
To serve Thee, gracious Saviour, 
And magnify Thy name. 
 
 


236 YERBURY

1. THY love we own, Lord Jesus, 
In service unremitting;
Within the veil
Thou dost prevail, 
Each soul for service fitting. 
Encompassed here with failure,
Each earthly refuge fails us;
Without, within,
Beset with sin,
Thy name alone avails us.

2. Thy love we own, Lord Jesus, 
For, though Thy toils are ended,
Thy tender heart
Doth take its part
With those Thy grace befriended. 
Thy sympathy how precious! 
Thou succourest in sorrow,
And bid'st us cheer
While pilgrims here, 
And haste the hopeful morrow.

3. Thy love we own, Lord Jesus; 
Thy way is traced before Thee—
Thou wilt descend
And we ascend 
To meet in heavenly glory.
Soon shall the blissful morning
Call forth Thy saints to meet Thee,
Our only Lord,
Alone adored:
With gladness then we'll greet Thee.

4. Thy love we own, Lord Jesus, 
And wait to see Thy glory;
To know as known
And fully own
Thy perfect grace before Thee. 
We plead Thy parting promise, 
Come, Saviour, to release us;
Then endless praise
Our lips shall raise 
For love like Thine, Lord Jesus.
 


237 BISHOPGARTH

1. THY name we bless, Lord Jesus—
That name all names excelling.
How great Thy love 
(All praise above) 
Should every tongue be telling. 
The Father's loving kindness 
In giving Thee was shown us,
Now by Thy blood
Redeemed to God, 
As children He doth own us.

2. From that eternal glory
Thou hadst with God the Father,
He sent His Son
That He in one
His people all might gather. 
Our sins were all laid on Thee,
God's wrath Thou hast endured;
It was for us
Thou suffer'dst thus, 
And hast our peace secured.

3. Thou from the dead wast raised, 
And from all condemnation
The Church is free,
As raised in Thee, 
Head of the new creation. 
On high Thou hast ascended 
To God's right hand in heaven;
The Lamb once slain
Alive again,
To Thee all power is given.
 
4. Thou hast bestowed the earnest 
Of that we shall inherit;
Till Thou shalt come 
To take us home
We're sealed by God the Spirit. 
We wait for Thine appearing, 
When we shall know more fully
The grace divine
That made us Thine, 
Thou Lamb of God most holy.
 


238 CARITAS

1. ONE there is above all others,
Oh how He loves! 
His is love beyond a brother's,
Oh how He loves! 
Earthly friends may fail or leave us, 
One day soothe, the next day grieve us, 
But this Friend will ne'er deceive us;
Oh how He loves!

2. 'Tis eternal life to know Him,
Oh how He loves! 
Think, oh think how much we owe Him,
Oh, how He loves!
With His precious blood He bought us, 
In the wilderness He sought us,
To His fold He safely brought us;
Oh how He loves!

3. What a Friend is our Lord Jesus,
Oh how He loves! 
'Tis His great delight to bless us,
Oh how He loves! 
How our hearts delight to hear Him 
Bid us dwell in safety near Him!
Why should we distrust or fear Him?
Oh how He loves!
 
4. Through His name we are forgiven,
Oh how He loves!
Backward shall our foes be driven,
Oh how He loves!
Best of blessings He'll provide us,
Nought but good shall e'er betide us, 
Safe to glory He will guide us,
Oh how He loves!
 


239 ROOM FOR JESUS

1.  SON of God, 'twas love that made Thee
Die, our ruined souls to save;
'Twas our sins' vast load that laid Thee,
Lord of life, within the grave. 
But Thy glorious resurrection
Showed Thee conqueror o'er the tomb; 
So the saints, by Thy protection,
Through Thy work shall overcome.

2. Thou to heaven hast now ascended,
Entering there by Thine own blood, 
All Thy work of suffering ended,
Fully wrought the will of God.
For Thy saints Thou still art caring,
For us pleading in Thy love, 
And our place of rest preparing
In the Father's house above.

3. Now the Paraclete doth gather
To Thy name Thy people here; 
So we worship God the Father,
Serve in love and holy fear.
What a debt of love we owe Thee,
Love that we can ne'er express,
Since we through the Spirit know Thee,
Christ the Lord, our righteousness! 

 


240 ARTAXERXES

1. LORD Jesus Christ, the thought of Thee 
With sweetness fills my breast;
But better far Thy face to see,
And in Thy presence rest.

2. Nor voice can sing, nor heart can frame, 
Nor can the memory find
A sweeter sound than Thy blest name, 
O Saviour of mankind.

3. O Hope of every contrite heart,
Thou joy of all the meek,
To those who fall how kind Thou art, 
How good to those who seek!

4. But what to those who find! Ah, this 
Nor tongue, nor pen can show; 
Thy love, Lord Jesus, what it is
None but Thy loved ones know.

5. Our only joy and strength be Thou,
As Thou our crown wilt be;
Be Thou, O Lord, our glory now
And through eternity. Amen.
 


241 ST. BEES

1. HARK, my soul, it is the Lord,
'Tis thy Saviour, hear His word; 
Now He speaks, and speaks to thee,
"Ransomed sinner, lovest thou Me?

2. "I delivered thee when bound,
And when wounded healed thy wound, 
Sought thee wandering, set thee right, 
Turned thy darkness into light.

3. "Can a mother's tender care
Cease toward the child she bare? 
Yes, she may forgetful be,
Yet will I remember thee.

4. "Mine is an unchanging love, 
Higher than the heights above, 
Deeper than the depths beneath, 
Free and faithful, strong as death.

5. "Thou shalt see My glory soon, 
When the work of grace is done; 
Partner of My throne shalt be—
Ransomed sinner, lovest thou Me?"

6. Lord, it is my chief complaint 
That my love is weak and faint, 
Yet I love Thee and adore;
Oh for grace to love Thee more! 
 


242 AGAPE

1. LORD Jesus, Lord Jesus, 
How vast Thy love to me!
I'll bathe in its full ocean 
To all eternity,
And wending on to glory
This all my song shall be, 
"I was a guilty sinner,
But Thou hast died for me."

2. Oh Calv'ry, oh Calv'ry,
The thorn-crown and the spear¬
'Tis here Thy love, Lord Jesus,
Thy grievous wounds appear. 
What depths of grace and mercy 
So richly flow from Thee!
I was a guilty sinner,
But Thou hast died for me.

3. Adore Him, adore Him;
The glorious work is done.
Sin's judgment ne'er will harm me;
'Twas laid upon God's Son.
He suffering cried, "'Tis finished,"
And I my pardon see;
I was a guilty sinner,
But Thou hast died for me.

4. In glory, in glory,
For ever with the Lord, 
I with the heavenly chorus
Shall sing with sweet accord; 
And as I gaze upon Him,
My gladsome song shall be 
Melodious with the praises 
Of Christ who died for me.
 


243 SALVATORI

1. O LORD, Thy love's unbounded,
So sweet, so full, so free; 
My soul is all transported
Whene'er I think of Thee.
Yet, Lord, alas! what weakness
Within myself I find;
No infant's changing pleasure 
Is like my wandering mind.

2. And yet Thy love's unchanging,
And doth recall my heart 
To joy in all its brightness,
The peace its beams impart. 
Yet, sure, if in Thy presence
My soul still constant were,
Mine eye would, more familiar,
Its brighter glories bear.

3. And thus Thy deep perfections
Much better should I know, 
And with adoring fervour
In this Thy nature grow. 
Still sweet 'tis to discover,
If clouds have dimmed my sight, 
When passed, eternal Lover,
As ever, Thou art bright.

4. Oh, keep my soul, Lord Jesus,
Abiding still with Thee;
And if I wander, teach me
Soon back to Thee to flee. 
That all Thy gracious favour 
May to my soul be known; 
And versed in this Thy goodness, 
My hopes Thyself shalt crown.
 


244 JOY IN SORROW

1. I'VE found a joy in sorrow, 
A secret balm for pain, 
A beautiful tomorrow
Of sunshine after rain;
I've found a branch of healing
Near every bitter spring,
A whispered promise stealing
O'er every broken string.

2. I've found a glad hosanna
For every woe and wail, 
A handful of sweet manna
When grapes of Eshcol fail;
I've found a Rock of ages
When desert wells are dry, 
And after weary stages
I've found an Elim nigh;

3. An Elim with its coolness,
Its fountains and its shade; 
A blessing in its fulness,
When buds of promise fade. 
O'er tears of sweet contrition
I've seen a rainbow light, 
A glory and fruition,
So near though out of sight.

4. Lord Jesus, Thee possessing,
I have the joy, the balm,
The healing and the blessing,
The sunshine and the psalm, 
The promise for the fearful, 
The Elim for the faint,
The rainbow for the tearful,
The glory for the saint.
 


245 HOLLINGSIDE

1. JESUS, Lover of my soul,
Let me to Thy bosom fly, 
While the raging billows roll, 
While the tempest still is high. 
Hide me, O my Saviour, hide, 
Till the storm of life is o'er; 
Safe into the haven guide,
Where the tempest's heard no more.

2. Other refuge have I none,
Hangs my helpless soul on Thee; 
Leave, ah, leave me not alone, 
Still support and comfort me. 
All my trust on Thee is stayed, 
All my help from Thee I bring;
Cover my defenceless head
With the shadow of Thy wing.

3. Thou, O Christ, art all I want, 
More than all in Thee I find; 
Raise the fallen, cheer the faint, 
Heal the sick and lead the blind. 
Just and holy is Thy name,
I am all unrighteousness,
I am full of sin and shame,
Thou art full of truth and grace.

4. Plenteous grace with Thee is found, 
Grace to pardon all my sin;
Let the healing streams abound, 
Make and keep me pure within. 
Thou of life the fountain art, 
Freely let me take of Thee; 
Spring Thou up within my heart, 
Rise to all eternity.


 


246 PURLEIGH

1. O LOVE divine, how sweet thou art! 
When shall I find my willing heart 
All taken up by thee?
Oh, may I pant and thirst to prove 
The greatness of redeeming love, 
The love of God to me!

2. God only knows the love of God; 
Oh, that it more were shed abroad
In this poor heart of mine! 
For love I sigh, for love I pine; 
This only portion, Lord, be mine,
Be mine the better part.

3. Oh, that I may for ever sit,
Like Mary, at the Master's feet—
Be this my happy choice;
My only care, my only bliss,
My joy, my heaven on earth be this, 
To hear the Bridegroom's voice.

4. Oh, that I may, like favoured John, 
Recline my wearied head upon
The great Redeemer's breast! 
From care and sin and sorrow free, 
Give me, O Lord, to find in Thee
My everlasting rest.
 


247 TRANQUILLITY

1. LORD Jesus, Thou who only art
The endless source of purest joy,
Oh come and fill this longing heart,
May nought but Thou my thoughts employ. 
Teach me on Thee to fix mine eye,
For none but Thou can satisfy.

2. The joys of earth can never fill
The heart that's tasted of Thy love; 
No portion would I seek until
I reign with Thee, my Lord, above; 
When I shall gaze upon Thy face, 
And know more fully all Thy grace.

3. When from the radiant throne on high 
Thou didst my fall and ruin see,
Thou cam'st to earth for me to die
That I might share Thy throne with Thee; 
Loved with an everlasting love,
My hopes, my joys are all above.

4. Oh what is all that earth can give? 
I'm called to share in God's own joy!
 Dead to the world, in Thee I live,
In Thee I've bliss without alloy; 
Well may I earthly joys resign,
All things are mine and I am Thine.

5. Till Thou shalt come to take me home, 
Be this my one ambition, Lord,
Self, sin, the world to overcome, 
Fast clinging to Thy faithful word; 
More of Thyself each day to know, 
And more into Thine image grow.
 


248 ST. CATHERINE

1. OH, draw me, Saviour, after Thee! 
So shall I run and never tire;
With gracious words still comfort me, 
Be Thou my hope, my sole desire. 
Free me from every weight. Nor fear 
Nor sin can come if Thou art near.

2. What in Thy love possess I not?
My star by night, my sun by day,
My spring of life when parched with drought, 
My wine to cheer, my bread to stay,
My strength, my shield, my safe abode, 
My robe before the throne of God.

3. From all eternity with love
Unchangeable Thou hast me viewed; 
Ere knew this beating heart to move, 
Thy tender mercies me pursued;
Ever with me may they abide,
And close me in on every side. Amen.
 


249 IT PASSETH KNOWLEDGE

1. It passeth knowledge, that dear love of Thine, 
Lord Jesus, Saviour; yet this soul of mine 
Would of Thy love, in all its breadth and length, 
Its height and depth, its everlasting strength,
Know more and more.
 
2. It passeth telling, that dear love of Thine, 
Lord Jesus, Saviour; yet these lips of mine 
Would fain proclaim to sinners, far and near, 
A love which can remove all guilty fear,
And love beget.

3. It passeth praises, that dear love of Thine, 
Lord Jesus, Saviour; yet this heart of mine 
Would sing that love, so full, so rich, so free, 
Which brings a rebel sinner, even me,
Nigh unto God.

4. But though I cannot sing or tell or know
The fulness of Thy love while here below, 
My empty vessel I may freely bring;
O Thou, who art of love the living spring,
My vessel fill!

5. Oh, fill me, holy Saviour, with Thy love; 
Lead, lead me to the living fount above. 
Thither may I in simple faith draw nigh, 
And never to another fountain fly,
But unto Thee.

6. And when, Lord Jesus, Thine own face I see, 
When at Thy lofty throne I bow the knee, 
Then of Thy love in all its breadth and length, 
Its height and depth, its everlasting strength,
My soul shall sing.
 


250 BELMONT

1. How sweet the name of Jesus sounds
In a believer's ear!
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds, 
And drives away his fear.

2. It makes the wounded spirit whole,
And calms the troubled breast; 
'Tis manna to the hungry soul,
And to the weary rest.

3. Dear Name! the rock on which we build, 
Our shield and hiding place;
Our never-failing treasury, filled
With boundless stores of grace.

4. Lord Jesus, Saviour, Shepherd, Friend, 
Our Prophet, Priest and King,
Our Lord, our Life, our Way, our End, 
Accept the praise we bring.

5. Weak is the effort of the heart,
And cold our warmest thought; 
But when we see Thee as Thou art,
We'll praise Thee as we ought.

6. Till then we would Thy love proclaim 
With every fleeting breath;
And glory in Thy blessed name
That quells the power of death.



251 LOUGHTON

1. THERE is a name I love to hear,
I love to speak its worth;
It sounds like music in mine ear,
The sweetest name on earth.

2. It tells me of a Saviour's love,
Who died to set me free;
It tells me of His precious blood, 
The sinner's only plea.

3. It tells me of a Father's love
Beaming upon His child;
It cheers me through this little while,
Through desert, waste and wild.

4. It tells me what my Father hath
In store for me each day;
And though I tread a darksome path, 
Yields sunshine all the way.

5. It tells of One whose loving heart 
Can feel my every woe,
Who in each sorrow bears a part
That none can bear below.

6. It bids my trembling soul rejoice, 
It dries each rising tear;
It tells me in a still small voice,
To trust and not to fear.
 
7."Jesus," the name I love so well, 
The name I love to hear;
No saint on earth its worth can tell,
No heart conceive how dear.

8. This name shall shed its fragrance still 
Along the thorny road,
Shall sweetly smooth the rugged hill 
That leads me up to God;

9. And there, with all the blood-bought throng,
From sin and sorrow free,
I'll sing the new, eternal song,
His boundless love to me.
 


252 MUNICH

1. LORD JESUS, Friend unfailing, 
How dear Thou art to me! 
Are cares or fears assailing?
I find my strength in Thee.
Why should my feet grow weary 
Of this my pilgrim way?
Rough though the path and dreary, 
It ends in perfect day.

2. Nought, nought I court as pleasure, 
Compared, O Christ, with Thee. 
Thy sorrow without measure
Earned peace and joy for me.
I love to own, Lord Jesus,
Thy claims o'er me divine;
Bought with Thy blood most precious, 
Whose can I be but Thine?

3. What fills my heart with gladness?
'Tis Thine abounding grace. 
Where can I look in sadness,
O Lord, but on Thy face? 
My all is Thy providing,
Thy love can ne'er grow cold. 
In Thee, my refuge, hiding,
No good wilt Thou withhold.

4. Why should I droop in sorrow? 
Thou'rt ever by my side.
Why, trembling, dread the morrow, 
What ill can e'er betide?
If I my cross have taken,
'Tis but to follow Thee;
If scorned, despised, forsaken,
Nought severs Thee from me.

5. O worldly pomp and glory,
Your charms are spread in vain. 
I've heard a sweeter story,
I've found a truer gain. 
Where Christ a place prepareth,
There is my loved abode,
There shall I gaze upon Him,
There ever dwell with God.

6. For every tribulation,
For every sore distress,
In Christ I've full salvation, 
Sure help and quiet rest.
No fear of foes prevailing, 
I triumph, Lord, in Thee.
Lord Jesus, Friend unfailing, 
How dear Thou art to me!
 


253 VAIL

1. THOU, my everlasting portion,
More than friend or life to me, 
All along my pilgrim journey,
Saviour, let me walk with Thee,
Close to Thee.
All along my pilgrim journey, 
Saviour, let me walk with Thee.

2. Not for ease or worldly pleasure,
Not for fame my prayer shall be; 
Gladly would I toil and suffer,
Only let me walk with Thee,
Close to Thee.
Gladly would I toil and suffer, 
Only let me walk with Thee.

3. Lead me through the vale of shadows; 
Bear me o'er life's fitful sea ;
Then the gate of life eternal
I shall enter, Lord, with Thee,
Close to Thee.
Then the gate of life eternal
I shall enter, Lord, with Thee. 
 
 


254 I'VE FOUND A FRIEND

1. I'VE found a Friend, oh, such a Friend!
He loved me ere I knew Him;
He drew me with the cords of love,
And thus He bound me to Him.
And round my heart still closely twine
Those ties which nought can sever; 
For I am His and He is mine,
For ever and for ever.

2. I've found a Friend, oh, such a Friend! 
He bled, He died to save me;
And not alone the gift of life,
But His own self He gave me. 
Nought that I have mine own I'd call, 
I hold it for the Giver;
My heart, my strength, my life, my all, 
Are His, and His for ever.

3. I've found a Friend, oh, such a Friend!
All power to Him is given,
To guard me on my onward course
And bring me safe to heaven. 
Th'eternal glories gleam afar
To nerve my faint endeavour;
So now to watch, to work, to war,
And then, to rest for ever.

4. I've found a Friend, oh, such a Friend!
So kind, and true, and tender; 
So wise a Counsellor and Guide,
So mighty a Defender!
From Him, who loves me now so well,
What power my soul shall sever?
Shall life or death? Shall earth or hell?
No, I am His for ever.
 


255  I HAVE A FRIEND

1. I HAVE a Friend, whose faithful love 
Is more than all the world to me; 
'Tis higher than the heights above, 
And deeper than the soundless sea.
So old, so new,
So strong, so true;
Before the earth received its frame 
He loved me. 
Blessed be His name!

2. He held the highest place above, 
Adored by all the sons of flame; 
Yet, such His self-denying love, 
He laid aside His crown and came
To seek the lost,
And, at the cost
Of heavenly rank and earthly fame, 
He sought me. 
Blessed be His name!

3. It was a lonely path He trod,
From every human soul apart; 
Known only to Himself and God 
Was all the grief that filled His heart;
Yet from the track
He turned not back
Till, where I lay in want and shame, 
He found me. 
Blessed be His name!

4. Then dawned at last that day of dread 
When, desolate, yet undismayed,
With wearied frame and thorn-crowned head
He, now forsaken and betrayed, 
Went up for me
To Calvary,
And, dying there in grief and shame,
He saved me. 
Blessed be His name!

 5. Long as I live my soul shall tell
The wonders of His matchless love; 
And when at last I rise to dwell
In the bright home prepared above,
My joy shall be
His face to see,
And, bowing then with loud acclaim, 
I'll praise Him. 
Blessed be His name!
 


256  CLARENDON STREET

1. LORD Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine, 
My rock and my fortress, my surety divine;
My gracious Redeemer, my Saviour art Thou; 
'Tis Thou who art worthy, Lord Jesus, 'tis Thou.

2. I love Thee because Thou hast first loved me, 
And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree;
I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow; 
'Tis Thou who art worthy, Lord Jesus, 'tis Thou.

3. I will love Thee in life, I will love Thee in death, 
And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath, 
And say if the death-dew lie cold on my brow,
" 'Tis Thou who art worthy, Lord Jesus, 'tis Thou."

4. In mansions of glory and endless delight, 
I then will adore Thee in regions of light,
And sing with the glittering crown on my brow,
" 'Tis Thou who art worthy, Lord Jesus, 'tis Thou."
 


257 VERONICA

1. CLING to the Mighty One, Cling in thy grief;
Cling to the Holy One, He gives relief;
Cling to the gracious One, Cling in thy pain;
Cling to the faithful One, He will sustain.

2. Cling to the Living One,
Cling in thy woe;
Cling to the loving One,
Through all below;
Cling to the pardoning One,
He speaketh peace; 
Cling to the healing One, Anguish shall cease.

3. Cling to the wounded One,
Cling to His side;
Cling to the risen One,
In Him abide;
Cling to the coming One, Hope shall arise;
Cling to the reigning One,
Joy lights thine eyes.
 


258 BULLINGER

1. ART thou weary, art thou languid,
Art thou sore distressed?
"Come to Me," saith One, "and coming, 
Be at rest! "

2. Hath He marks to lead me to Him, 
He who is my guide?
In His feet and hands are wound prints,
And His side.

3. Hath He diadem, as monarch,
That His brow adorns? 
Yea, a crown in very surety,
But of thorns.

4.  If my Master close I follow,
What His guerdon here?
Many a sorrow, many a labour,
Many a tear.

5. If I still walk closely with Him,
What hath He at last?
Sorrow vanquished, labour ended, 
Jordan passed.

6. If I ask Him to sustain me,
Will He say me Nay?
Not though earth and not though heaven 
Pass away.

7. Finding, following, keeping, struggling—
Is He sure to bless?
Saints, apostles, prophets, martyrs,
Answer," Yes."
 


259 PRECIOUS NAME

1. TAKE the name of Jesus with you
In your path of weal and woe; 
It will joy and comfort give you,
Take it then where'er you go.

Precious name! oh, how sweet! 
Hope of earth and joy of heaven.

2. Take the name of Jesus ever,
As a shield from every snare.
If temptations round you gather,
Breathe that holy name in prayer.

3. Oh, the precious name of Jesus,
How it thrills our souls with joy! 
Let us tell of Him who guards us;
Let His songs our tongues employ.

4. At the name of Jesus bowing,
Falling prostrate at His feet,
King of kings in heaven we'll own Him, 
When our journey is complete.
 


260 CELESTE

1. WE'LL sing of the Shepherd that died, 
That died for the sake of the flock; 
His love to the utmost was tried,
But firmly endured as a rock.

2. When blood from a victim must flow
This Shepherd, by pity, was led
To stand in our place and to know
The suffering and death in our stead.

3. Our song, then, for ever shall be
Of the Shepherd who gave Himself thus; 
No subject's so glorious as He,
Nor theme so affecting to us.

4. We'd sing of such subjects alone,
None other our tongues should employ, 
Till better His love becomes known
In yonder bright regions of joy.
 


261  ST. MATTHIAS

1. LORD Jesus, teach us still to keep
Our eyes on Thee, the living way;
That we, once lost and wandering sheep, 
From Thee, our Lord, no more may stray; 
But wheresoe'er Thou leadest, we
May follow on most cheerfully.

2. Oh, that we never might forget
What Thou hast suffered for our sake, 
To save our souls, and make us meet 
In all Thy glory to partake;
But keeping this in sight press on 
To glory and a victor's crown!

3. But, gracious Lord, when we reflect 
How oft we've turned our eye from Thee;
Have treated Thee with sad neglect
And listened to the enemy;
And yet to find Thee still the same 
'Tis this that humbles us with shame.

4. Astonished at Thy feet we fall;
Thy love exceeds our highest thought; 
Henceforth be Thou our all in all,  
Thou, who our souls with blood hast bought
May we henceforth more faithful prove, 
And ne'er forget Thy ceaseless love.
 


262 CRIMOND

1. THE Lord's my Shepherd, I'll not want; 
He makes me down to lie
In pastures green; He leadeth me 
The quiet waters by.

2. My soul He doth restore again;
And me to walk doth make
Within the paths of righteousness,
E'en for His own name's sake.

3. Yea, though I walk in death's dark vale, 
Yet will I fear none ill;
For Thou art with me, and Thy rod 
And staff me comfort still.

4. My table Thou hast furnished
In presence of my foes;
My head Thou dost with oil anoint, 
And my cup overflows.

5. Goodness and mercy all my life 
Shall surely follow me;
And in God's house for evermore
My dwelling place shall be.



263 DOMINUS REGIT ME

1. THE King of love my Shepherd is,
Whose goodness faileth never; 
I nothing lack since I am His
And He is mine for ever.

2. Where streams of living water flow
My ransomed soul He leadeth;
And where the verdant pastures grow,
With food celestial feedeth.

3. Perverse and foolish oft I strayed,
But yet in love He sought me, 
And on His shoulder gently laid
And home rejoicing brought me.

4. In death's dark vale I fear no ill
With Thee, dear Lord, beside me; 
Thy rod and staff my comfort still,
Thy cross before to guide me.

5. And so through all the length of days 
Thy goodness faileth never;
Good Shepherd, may I sing Thy praise 
Within God's house for ever.
 


264 PROVIDENCE

1. JEHOVAH'S my Shepherd, no want shall I know,
He maketh me lie down where green pastures grow; 
Beside the still waters He tenderly guides;
My soul He restoreth by things He provides.

2. He leadeth me then, for the sake of His name,
In paths that are righteous, to walk in the same;
E'en though through the valley, death's shadow, I tread, 
Because Thou art with me no ill will I dread.

3. Thou comfortest me by Thy rod and Thy staff; 
With enemies nigh me, Thou, on my behalf, 
Preparest a table. Then doest Thou more—
My head Thou anointest; my cup runneth o'er.

4. I've nought, all the days of my life, to repine, 
Since goodness and mercy shall surely be mine; 
The house of Jehovah my dwelling shall be 
Both now and for ever. Praise be unto Thee.
 


265 RECOMPENSE

1. OUR Lord His glory laid aside,
That He had known with God,
Then came to earth as man and died
To cleanse us by His blood.
Good Shepherd He, stray sheep He sought, 
Stooped low and suffered loss;
He bore the hiding of God's face,
A curse upon the cross.

2. He's risen now, and lives on high, 
Again He's glorified;
And ever liveth there to save
His sheep for whom He died.
As Shepherd Great, with crook in hand,
He tends them all with care;
E'en through death's shadow, and midst foes,
He's present with them there.

3. Soon, as Chief Shepherd, He will come
His loved ones home to take,
When those who've served shall have reward, 
Who wrought for His name's sake. 
Crowned King of glory then He'll be,
And Lord of Hosts beside;
For Him the heads of lasting doors,
And gates will open wide.

4. The Shepherd thus, Good, Great, and Chief,
By cross, and crook, and crown, 
Salvation threefold will have wrought
For those He calls His own.
Our God, we're longing for that day
To see the Shepherd King,
Who, with all gathered saints at home,
Will lead the song they sing.
 


266 GOSHEN 

1. JESUS is our Shepherd, wiping every tear; 
Folded in His bosom, what have we to fear? 
Only let us follow whither He doth lead,
To the thirsty desert or the dewy mead.

2. Jesus is our Shepherd, well we know His voice; 
How its gentlest whisper makes our heart rejoice! 
Even when He chideth, tender is His tone;
None but He shall guide us. We are His alone.

3. Jesus is our Shepherd, for His sheep He bled;
Every lamb is sprinkled with the blood He shed;
Then on each He setteth His own secret sign,
"They that have My Spirit, these," saith He, "are Mine."

4. Jesus is our Shepherd, guarded by His arm,
Though the wolves may ravin, none can do us harm. 
Should we tread death's valley, dark with fearful gloom, 
We will fear no evil, victors o'er the tomb.

5. Jesus is our Shepherd, with His goodness now 
And His tender mercy, He doth us endow; 
Let us sing His praises with a gladsome heart,
Very soon we'll meet Him, never more to part.
 


Section 11.  Praise to, and Communion with the Lord Jesus Christ

267 SOLYMA

1. O PATIENT, spotless One, 
Our hearts in meekness train
To bear Thy yoke and learn of Thee, 
That we may rest obtain.

2. O Lord, Thou art enough 
The mind and heart to fill;
Thy life to calm each anxious thought,
Thy love each fear dispel.

3. Oh, fix our earnest gaze
So wholly, Lord, on Thee
That, with Thy beauty occupied,
We elsewhere none may see. Amen.
 
 


268 CLAREMONT

1. OH, teach us more of Thy blest ways, 
Thou holy Lamb of God;
And fix and root us in Thy grace,
As those redeemed by blood.

2. Oh, tell us often of Thy love,
Of all Thy grief and pain;
And let our hearts with joy confess
That thence comes all our gain.

3.  For this, oh, may we freely count
Whate'er we have but loss;
The dearest object of our love, 
Compared with Thee but dross!

4. Engrave this deeply on our heart 
With an eternal pen,
That we may, in some small degree,
Return Thy love again. Amen.
 


269 SARRATT

1. OH come, Thou stricken Lamb of God, 
Who shedd'st for us Thine own life-blood, 
And teach us all Thy love; then pain 
Were sweet, and life or death were gain.

2. Take Thou our hearts, and let them be
For ever closed to all but Thee;
Thy willing servants, let us wear
The seal of love for ever there.

3. How blest are they who still abide 
Close sheltered by Thy watchful side,
Who life and strength from Thee receive, 
And with Thee move, and in Thee live!

4. How can it be, Thou heavenly King, 
That Thou shouldst man to glory bring, 
Make slaves the partners of Thy throne, 
Decked with a never-fading crown ?

5. O Lord, enlarge our scanty thought
To know the wonders Thou hast wrought ; 
Unloose our stammering tongues to tell 
Thy love immense, unsearchable.

6. First-born of many brethren Thou, 
To whom both heaven and earth must bow!
Heirs of Thy shame and of Thy throne, 
We bear the cross and seek the crown.


 


270 JUST AS I AM

1. O HOLY Saviour, Friend unseen,
Since on Thine arm Thou bidd'st us lean, 
Help us throughout life's changing scene 
By faith to cling to Thee.

2. Blest with this fellowship divine,
Take what Thou wilt, we'll ne'er repine; 
Since, blessed Saviour, we are Thine, 
And we may cling to Thee.

3. Far from our home, fatigued, oppressed, 
Here we have found our place of rest, 
As exiles still, yet not unblest,
While we can cling to Thee.

4. Without a murmur, we'd dismiss 
Our former dreams of earthly bliss; 
Our joy, our consolation this,
Each hour to cling to Thee.

5. What though the world deceitful prove, 
And earthly friends and hopes remove? 
With patient, uncomplaining love,
Still would we cling to Thee.

6. Oft when we seem to tread alone
Some barren waste with thorns o'ergrown, 
Thy voice of love in gentlest tone
Whispers, "Still cling to Me."

7. Blest is our lot, whate'er befall; 
What can affright or who appal, 
While as our strength, our rock, our all,
Saviour, we cling to Thee?
 


271 FARRANT

1. O CHILD of God, there is for thee
One only safe retreat—
Where Jesus is thy heart should be,
Thy dwelling at His feet.

2. When Satan tracks thy lonely way,
There his temptations meet;
In Jesus' presence watch and pray,
Yea, conquer at His feet.

3. Since thou hast much to learn, although
Thou art in Christ complete,
In grace and knowledge seek to grow, 
By sitting at His feet.

4. Through tribulation hasten on,
With Christ the cross is sweet; 
The little while will soon be gone;
Keep only at His feet.

5. O child of God, forget the past,
Prepare thy Lord to greet,
That thou may'st share His throne, and cast,
Thy crown before His feet.
 


272 EVANGELIST

1. O LORD, I would delight in Thee, 
And on Thy care depend;
To Thee in every trouble flee, 
My sure, my steadfast Friend.

2. When human cisterns all are dried, 
Thy fulness is the same;
May I with this be satisfied,
And glory in Thy name.

3. Why should I thirst for aught below,
While there's a fountain near, 
A fountain which doth ever flow,
The fainting heart to cheer?

4. No good in creatures can be found 
Apart, O Lord, from Thee.
I must have all things and abound 
Since Thou art all to me.

5. Oh, that I had but simpler faith 
To live within the veil;
To feed on what the Lord hath said, 
Whose word can never fail!

6. He that hath made my heaven secure, 
Will all I need provide.
While Christ is rich, can I be poor—
Christ, who for me hath died?

7. O Lord, I cast my care on Thee; 
I triumph and adore;
Oh, that my great concern may be
To love and praise Thee more!


273 EVENTIDE

1. ABIDE with me; fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens, Lord, with me abide. 
When other helpers fail, and comforts flee, 
Help of the helpless, oh abide with me!

2. Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day; 
Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away; 
Change and decay in all around I see;
O Thou who changest not, abide with me!

3. Not a brief glance I beg, a passing word;
But as Thou dwelt'st with Thy disciples, Lord, 
Familiar, condescending, patient, free,
Come not to sojourn, but abide with me!

4. Thou on my head in early youth didst smile, 
And, though rebellious and perverse meanwhile, 
Thou hast not left me, oft as I left Thee;
On to the close, O Lord, abide with me!

5. I need Thy presence every passing hour;
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power? 
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be? 
Through cloud and sunshine, oh abide with me!

6. I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness. 
Where is death's sting, and where death's victory? 
I triumph still if Thou abide with me.

7. Hold Thou Thy cross before my faltering eyes, 
Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies.
Morn soon shall break, and earth's vain shadows flee; 
Till that bright dawning, Lord, abide with me.
 


274 DOANE

1. O LAMB of God, still keep me 
Near to Thy wounded side;
'Tis only there in safety
And peace I can abide.
What foes and snares surround me!
What lusts and fears within!
The grace that sought and found me
Alone can keep me clean.

2. 'Tis only in Thee hiding,
I know my life secure;
Only in Thee abiding, 
The conflict can endure.
Thine arm the victory gaineth
O'er every hurtful foe;
Thy love my heart sustaineth
In all its cares and woe.

3. Soon shall my eyes behold Thee
With rapture face to face;
One half hath not been told me
Of all Thy power and grace. 
Thy beauty, Lord, and glory,
The wonders of Thy love, 
Shall be the endless story
Of all Thy saints above.
 


275 THE CROSS

1. BENEATH Thy cross, Lord Jesus,
I fain would take my stand—
The shadow of a mighty rock 
Within a weary land;
A home within the wilderness,
A rest upon the way,
From the burning of the noon-tide heat 
And the burden of the day.

2. O safe and happy shelter,
O refuge tried and sweet,
O trysting-place, where heaven's love
And heaven's justice meet!
As to the holy patriarch
That wondrous dream was given, 
So seems my Saviour's cross to me
A ladder up to heaven.

3. There lies beneath its shadow,
But on the farther side,
The darkness of an awful grave
That gapes both deep and wide;
And there between us stands the cross,
Two arms outstretched to save,
Like a watchman set to guard the way 
From that eternal grave.

4. Upon that cross of Jesus
My eyes at times can see
The very dying form of One 
Who suffered there for me;
And from my smitten heart with tears, 
Two wonders I confess—
The wonder of His dying love, 
And my own worthlessness.

5. I take Thy cross, Lord Jesus,
For my abiding place;
I ask no other sunshine than 
The sunshine of Thy face;
Content to let the world go by, 
To know no gain or loss;
My sinful self my only shame,
My glory all the cross.
 


276 . FLAVIAN 

1. WALK in the light, so shalt thou know 
That fellowship of love
His Spirit only can bestow,
Who reigns in light above.

2. Walk in the light, and thou shalt find 
Thy heart made truly His,
Who dwells in cloudless light enshrined, 
In whom no darkness is.

3. Walk in the light, o'er sin abhorred
Thou shalt the victory gain;
The blood of Jesus Christ the Lord
Shall cleanse from every stain.

4. Walk in the light, and e'en the tomb 
No fearful shade shall wear;
Glory shall chase away its gloom, 
For Christ hath conquered there.

5. Walk in the light, and thou shalt own 
Thy darkness passed away,
Because that light hath on thee shone 
In which is perfect day.

6. Walk in the light, thy path shall be
Steadfast, serene, and bright;
For God in grace shall dwell in thee,
And God Himself is light.
 


277 MASON

1. I THIRST, but not as once I did,
The vain delights of earth to share; 
Thy wounds, Immanuel, all forbid 
That I should seek my pleasure there.

2. It was the sight of Thy dear cross
First weaned my soul from earthly things, 
And taught me to esteem as dross
The mirth of fools and pomp of kings.

3. I want that grace that springs from Thee, 
That quickens all things where it flows, 
And makes a wretched thorn like me 
Bloom as the myrtle or the rose.

4. Dear Fountain of delights unknown, 
No longer sink below the brim,
But overflow and pour me down 
A living and life-giving stream.
 


278 THE PATH DIVINE

1. TEACH me Thy way, O Lord,
Teach me Thy way;
Thy gracious aid afford,
Teach me Thy way.
Help me to walk aright,
More-by faith, less by sight;
Lead me with heavenly light.
Teach me Thy way.

2. When doubts and fears arise, 
Teach me Thy way;
When storms o'erspread the skies, 
Teach me Thy way.
Shine through the cloud and rain, 
Through sorrow, toil and pain; 
Make Thou my pathway plain,
Teach me Thy way.

3. Long as my life shall last,
Teach me Thy way;
Where'er my lot be cast,
Teach me Thy way. 
Until the race is run, 
Until the journey's done, 
Until the crown is won,
Teach me Thy way.
 
 


278 TRUST AND OBEY

1. WHEN we walk with the Lord
In the light of His word,
What a glory He sheds on our way! 
While we do His good will
He abides with us still,
And with all who will trust and obey.

2.  Not a shadow can rise,
Not a cloud in the skies,
But His smile quickly drives it away; 
Not a doubt nor a fear,
Not a sigh nor a tear,
Can abide while we trust and obey. 

3. Not a burden we bear,
Not a sorrow we share,
But our toil He doth richly repay; 
Not a grief nor a loss,
Not a frown nor a cross,
But is blest if we trust and obey.

4. But we never can prove 
The delights of His love,
Until all on the altar we lay, 
For the favour He shows 
And the joy He bestows,
Are for those who will trust and obey.
 
5. Then in fellowship sweet
We will sit at His feet,
Or we'll walk by His side in the way; 
What He says we will do,
Where He sends we will go,
Never fear, only trust and obey.

Chorus to be sung at end of hymn:

Trust and obey, for there's no other way
To be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.
 


280 SOMETHING FOR THEE

1. SAVIOUR, Thy dying love 
Thou gavest me;
Nor should I aught withhold,
My Lord, from Thee.
In love my soul would bow,
My heart fulfil its vow, 
Some offering bring Thee now,
Something for Thee.

2. At the blest mercy-seat
'Pleading for me—
My feeble faith looks up,
O Lord, to Thee;
Help me the cross to bear,
Thy wondrous love declare, 
Some song to raise, or prayer,
Something for Thee.

3. Give me a faithful heart,
Likeness to Thee,
That each departing day
Henceforth may see
Some work of love begun,
Some deed of kindness done,
Some wanderer sought and won—
Something for Thee.

4. All that I am and have—
Thy gifts so free—
In joy, in grief, through life, 
O Lord, for Thee!
And when Thy face I see
My ransomed soul shall be 
Through all eternity
Something for Thee. 
 


281 THINE OWN WAY

1. HAVE Thine own way, Lord, 
Have Thine own way; 
Thou art the Potter,
I am the clay.
Mould me and make me 
After Thy will,
While I am waiting,
Yielded and still.

2. Have Thine own way, Lord,
Have Thine own way;
Search me and try me, 
Master, today.
Whiter than snow, Lord,
Wash me just now, 
As in Thy presence
Humbly I bow.

3. Have Thine own way, Lord,
Have Thine own way;
Wounded and weary,
Help me, I pray.
Power, all power, 
Surely is Thine;
Touch me and heal me, 
Saviour divine.

4. Have Thine own way, Lord,
Have Thine own way;
Hold o'er my being
Absolute sway.
Fill with Thy Spirit
Till all shall see
Christ only, always,
Living in me.
 


282 MAGISTER (OTTAWA)

1. MASTER, speak; Thy servant heareth,
Waiting for Thy gracious word,
Longing for Thy voice that cheereth;
Master, let it now be heard.
I am listening, Lord, for Thee—
What hast Thou to say to me?

2. Speak to me by name, O Master; 
Let me know it is to me.
Speak, that I may follow faster
With a step more firm and free,
Where the Shepherd leads the flock
In the shadow of the rock.

3. Master, speak; though least and lowest, 
Let me not unheard depart.
Master, speak, for oh, Thou knowest 
All the yearning of my heart! 
Knowest all its truest need;
Speak, and make me blest indeed.

4. Master, speak, and make me ready,
When Thy voice is truly heard, 
With obedience glad and steady
Still to follow every word;
I am listening, Lord, for Thee—
Master, speak, oh speak to me!
 


283 LLOYD

1. FILL Thou my life, O Lord my God,
In every part with praise,
That my whole being may proclaim 
Thy Being and Thy ways.

2. Not for the lip of praise alone,
Nor e'en the praising heart 
I ask, but for a life made up
Of praise in every part;

3. Praise in the common things of life, 
Its goings out and in;
Praise in each duty and each deed, 
However small and mean.

4. Fill every part of me with praise; 
Let all my being speak
Of Thee and of Thy love, O Lord,
Poor though I be and weak.

5. So shalt Thou, Lord, from me, e'en me, 
Receive the glory due;
And so shall I begin on earth
The song for ever new.

6. So shall each fear, each fret, each care, 
Be turned into song,
And every winding of the way
The echo shall prolong.

7. So shall no part of day or night
From sacredness be free,
But all my life, in every step,
Be fellowship with Thee.
 


284 LATHBURY

1. BREAK Thou the bread of life,
Dear Lord, to me,
As Thou didst break the bread
Beside the sea.
Beyond the sacred page
I seek Thee, Lord;
My spirit longs for Thee,
Thou living Word.

2. Thou art the bread of life, 
O Lord, to me;
Thy holy word the truth 
That saveth me.
Give me to eat and live
With Thee above;
Teach me to love Thy truth, 
For Thou art love.

3. Oh, may Thy Spirit, Lord, 
So quicken me
That He may touch my eyes 
And make me see;
Show me the truth concealed 
Within Thy word,
Then in Thy book revealed 
I'll see Thee, Lord.

4. Bless Thou the bread of life 
To me, to me,
As Thou didst bless the loaves 
By Galilee;
Then shall all bondage cease, 
All fetters fall,
And I shall find my peace, 
My all in all.


285 STOUGHTON

1. I LIFT my heart to Thee,
Saviour divine;
For Thou art all to me,
And I am Thine.
Is there on earth a closer bond than this—
That my Beloved's mine, and I am His?

2. Thine am I by all ties; 
But chiefly Thine,
That through Thy sacrifice 
Thou, Lord, art mine.
By Thine own cords of love, so sweetly wound
Around me, I to Thee am closely bound.

3. To Thee, Thou dying Lamb,
I all things owe;
All that I have and am,
And all I know.
All that I have is now no longer mine,
And I am not my own; Lord, I am Thine.

4. How can I, Lord, withhold
Life's brightest hour
From Thee; or gathered gold,
Or any power?
Why should I keep one precious thing from Thee, 
When Thou hast given Thine own dear self for me?
 
 


286 FRANCONIA

1. BLEST are the pure in heart, 
For they shall see their God;
The secret of the Lord is theirs, 
Their soul is Christ's abode.

2. The Lord, who left the heavens 
Our life and peace to bring,
To dwell in lowliness with men, 
Their pattern and their King;

3. Still to the lowly soul
He doth Himself impart,
And for His dwelling and His throne 
Chooseth the pure in heart.

4. Lord, we Thy presence seek, 
May ours this blessing be;
Give us a pure and lowly heart,
A temple meet for Thee.
 


287 OLDHAM STREET

1. "PRAISE ye the Lord!" again, again 
The Spirit strikes the chord;
Nor toucheth He our hearts in vain,
We praise, we praise the Lord.

2. "Rejoice in Him!" again, again
The Spirit speaks the word;
And faith takes up the happy strain, 
Our joy is in the Lord.

3. "Stand fast in Christ!" ah, yet again 
He teaches all the band;
All human efforts are in vain,
In Christ alone we stand.

4. "Clean, every whit!" Thou saidst it, Lord
Shall one suspicion lurk?	
Thine, surely, is a faithful word,
And Thine a finished work.

5. For ever be the glory given
Unto the Christ of God;
Our every joy on earth, in heaven,
We owe to His shed blood.
 


288 LYNGHAM

1. OH, for a thousand tongues to sing
The great Redeemer's praise,
The glories of our God and King,
The triumphs of His grace!

2."Jesus," the name that calms our fears,
That bids our sorrows cease;
'Tis music in our ransomed ears,
'Tis life and health and peace.

3. He breaks the power of cancelled sin, 
He sets the prisoners free;
His blood can make the foulest clean; 
His blood availed for me.

4. He speaks, and, listening to His voice, 
New life the dead receive;
The mourning, weary souls rejoice,
The child-like hearts believe.

5. And soon for us He'll gladly come 
To take us hence away;
We'll sing His praise in yon bright home 
Throughout an endless day.

 


289 WALTON

1. WE sing the praise of Him who died, 
Of Him who died upon the cross—
The sinner's hope. Though men deride,
 For this we count the world but loss.

2. Inscribed upon the cross we see 
In shining letters, "God is Love."
The Lamb who died upon the tree 
Has brought us mercy from above.

3. The cross! it takes our guilt away,
 It holds the fainting spirit up;
It cheers with hope the gloomy day, 
And sweetens every bitter cup.

4. It makes the coward spirit brave, 
And nerves the feeble arm for fight; 
It takes its terrors from the grave,
 And gilds the bed of death with light.

5. The balm of life, the cure of woe, 
The measure and the pledge of love, 
The sinner's refuge here below,
The angel's theme in heaven above.
 


290 STAR OF PEACE

1. Jesus Christ, Thou King of glory,
Born a Saviour, Prince to be,
While the angel hosts adore Thee,
We joy in Thee;
Singing of Thy grace the story, 
Praise, praise to Thee!

2. Thou the bands of death didst sever,
Conflict Thine and victory; 
God is for us now and ever;
We joy in Thee.
We are Thine, Thine own for ever,
Praise, praise to Thee!

3. Thou the ransom price hast given,
Setting thus the captives free;
Thou art Lord of earth and heaven, We joy in Thee;
Through Thy blood we stand forgiven,
Praise, praise to Thee!

4. Risen Lord, at Thy returning
Sweet and full our song shall be; 
Hasting to that blissful morning,
We joy in Thee;
Thou hast read our spirits' yearning,
Praise, praise to Thee!



291 BURNHAM

1. JOIN all the glorious names
Of wisdom, love and power, 
That mortals ever knew,
That angels ever bore;
All are too mean to speak His worth, 
Too mean to set our Saviour forth.

2. Great Prophet of our God,
Our tongue would bless Thy name; 
By Thee the joyful news
Of our salvation came;
The joyful news of sins forgiven,
Of hell subdued, of peace with heaven.

3. Be Thou our Counsellor, 
Our pattern and our Guide; 
And through this desert land 
Still keep us near Thy side;
Oh, let our feet ne'er run astray,
Nor rove, nor seek the crooked way,

4. We love our Shepherd's voice; 
His watchful eye shall keep
Our wandering souls among
The thousands of His sheep;
He feeds His flock, He calls their names, 
His bosom bears the tender lambs.

5. Should all the hosts of death 
And powers of hell unknown, 
Put their most dreadful forms 
Of rage and mischief on,
We shall be safe; for Christ displays
Almighty power and guardian grace.



292 TRIUMPH

1. PRAISE the Lord who died to save us,
Praise His ever gracious name;
Praise Him that He lives to bless us,
Now and evermore the same;
Praise the Saviour!
We would all His love proclaim.

2. Grace it was, yea, grace abounding,
Brought Him down to save the lost. 
Ye above, the throne surrounding,
Praise Him, praise Him, all His host.
Saints adore Him;
We are they who owe Him most.

3. We of all His hand created
Objects of such grace alone,
By eternal love elected,
Destined now to share His throne, 
Sing with wonder,
Sing of what the Lord has done!

4. Praise His name who died to save us; 
'Tis by Him His people live,
And in Him the Father gave us
All that boundless love could give; 
Life eternal
In our Saviour we receive. 



293 CALVARY

1. COME, ye saints, rejoice with Jesus,
Called with Him His joy to share; 
Seraphs worship, angels praise Him,
We His friends and followers are.
Lost ones found and
Dead ones raised
Now the heart of Jesus cheer.

2. Praise the Lord, sing Hallelujah!
Endless praises let us bring;
Praise His name for these great mercies; 
Turn we now His praise to sing. 
Loudest praises
Make the court of heaven ring.

3. Praise Him, praise Him, never ceasing,
Ye who prove God's boundless grace; 
Have we asked and has He answered?
Thankful hearts to heaven raise.
He is worthy
To receive His people's praise.

4. Hallelujah! hallelujah!
Heartfelt praise to God we give;
They should loudest sing His praises,
Who His blessings thus receive.
Songs of praises
Let us render while we live.

5. Shout, ye ransomed heirs of heaven,
Saved to show God's praises forth; 
While ye shout let joys unspoken
Fill your hearts with heavenly mirth;
Hearts exulting,
Songs outbursting,
Put to shame the joys of earth.
 


294 FALCON STREET

1. BREAK forth and sing the song 
Of glory to His name;
Wake every heart and every tongue 
To celebrate His fame.

2. Sing of His dying love,
His resurrection power;
Sing how He intercedes above 
For those whose sins He bore.

3. Sing on your heavenly road, 
Ye heirs of glory, sing
Of the ascended Christ of God;
Your cheerful praises bring.

4. Soon we shall hear Him say, 
"Ye ransomed pilgrims, come;"
Soon will He call us hence away
And take us to His home.

5. Then shall each raptured tongue 
His fullest praise proclaim,
And sweeter voices wake the song 
Of glory to the Lamb.

Chorus at the end of the hymn.
 
Praise ye the Lord, Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Hallelujah! Praise ye the Lord.
Amen.
 


295  GEBHARDT

1. LORD, Thou source of life eternal,
Thou the author of our breath, 
Victor o'er the hosts infernal
By defeat and shame and death, 
Thou through deepest tribulation, 
Deigned to pass for our salvation;
Thousand, thousand praises be,
Lord of glory, unto Thee!

2. Thou, O Son of God, wert bearing
Cruel mockings, hatred, scorn; 
Thou, the King of glory, wearing
For our sake the crown of thorn! 
Dying, Thou didst us deliver
From the chains of sin for ever;
Thousand, thousand praises be,
Blessed Saviour, unto Thee!

3. All the shame men heaped upon Thee
 Thou didst patiently endure;
Not the pains of death too bitter 
Our redemption to procure. 
Wondrous Thy humiliation,
To accomplish our salvation; 
Thousand, thousand praises be
Blessed Saviour, unto Thee!

4. Heartfelt praise and adoration, 
Saviour, thus to Thee we give, 
For Thy deep humiliation,
For Thy death by which we live.
All the grief Thou hast endured,
All the bliss Thou hast secured; 
Evermore the theme shall be 
Of thanksgiving, Lord, to Thee.
 


296 HYFRYDOL

1. HAIL, Thou once despised Lord Jesus! 
Hail, Thou still rejected King! 
Thou didst suffer to release us,
Thou didst free salvation bring. 
Through Thy death and resurrection, 
Bearer of our sin and shame,
We enjoy divine protection,
Life and glory through Thy name.

2. Paschal Lamb by God appointed, 
All our sins on Thee were laid; 
By almighty love anointed
Thou hast full atonement made. 
All Thy people are forgiven
Through the virtue of Thy blood; 
Opened now the gate of heaven, 
Peace is made 'twixt man and God.

3. Hail, Lord Jesus, throned in glory,
Where for us Thou dost abide; 
All the heavenly hosts adore Thee
Seated at Thy Father's side.
There for us Thou now art pleading,
There Thou dost a place prepare, 
Ever for us interceding,
Till in glory we appear.

4. Worship, honour, power and blessing 
Christ is worthy to receive;
Loudest praises without ceasing, 
Meet it is for us to give.
Help, ye bright angelic spirits,
Bring your sweetest, noblest lays, 
Help to sing the Saviour's merits, 
Help to chant Immanuel's praise. 
 


297 ST. SYLVESTER

1. O LORD, I love Thee, not because
I hope for heaven thereby,
Nor yet because who love Thee not
Are lost eternally.
Thou, O Lord Jesus, didst for me
The shameful cross endure,
The crown of thorns, the nails, the spear,
The sorrows deep and sore;

2. And griefs and torments numberless, 
And sweat of agony;
Yea, death itself; and all for me
Who was Thine enemy.
Then why, O blest Lord Jesus Christ,
Should I not love Thee well?
Not for the hope of winning heaven,
Nor of escaping hell;

3. Not with the hope of gaining aught, 
Nor seeking a reward,
But as Thyself hast loved me,
O ever-loving Lord.
So would I love Thee, holy Lord,
And daily sing Thy praise,
Solely because Thou art my God,
Who saved me in Thy grace.
 


298 EULOGIA

1. PRAISE the Saviour, ye who know Him; 
Who can tell how much we owe Him? 
Gladly let us render to Him
All we have and are.

2. "Jesus" is the name that charms us; 
He for conflict fits and arms us; 
Nothing moves and nothing harms us
When we trust in Him.

3. Trust in Him, ye saints, for ever; 
He is faithful, changing never; 
Neither force nor guile can sever
Those He loves from Him.

4. Keep us, Lord, oh keep us cleaving 
To Thyself, and still believing,
Till the hour of our receiving
Promised joys in heaven.

5. Then we shall be where we would be, 
Then we shall be what we should be, 
Things which are not now, nor could be,
Then shall be our own.
 


299 WARRINGTON

1. MY song shall bless the Lord of all, 
My praise shall climb to His abode. 
Thee, Saviour, by that name I call, 
The great supreme, the mighty God.

2. Without beginning or decline, 
Object of faith, and not of sense; 
Eternal ages saw Him shine,
He shines eternal ages hence,

3. As much when in the manger laid 
Almighty Ruler of the sky,
As when the six days' work He made 
Filled all the wondering stars with joy.

4. Of all the crowns Jehovah bears, 
Salvation is His dearest claim;
That gracious sound well pleased He hears, 
And owns Immanuel for His name.

5. A cheerful confidence I feel,
My well-placed hopes with joy I see; 
My bosom glows with heavenly zeal 
To worship Him who died for me.

6. As man He pities my complaint, 
His power and truth are all divine; 
He will not fail, He cannot faint, 
Salvation's sure, and must be mine.
 


300 DIADEMATA

1. CROWN Him with many crowns, 
The Lamb upon His throne;
Hark, how the heavenly anthem drowns 
All music but its own!
Awake, my soul, and sing
Of Him who died for thee,
And hail Him as thy matchless King, 
Through all eternity.

2. Crown Him the Lord of life,
Who triumphed o'er the grave,
And rose victorious in the strife 
For those He came to save. 
His glories now we sing, 
Who died, and rose on high;
Who died eternal life to bring, 
And lives that death may die.

3. Crown Him the Lord of love; 
Behold His hands and side—
Those wounds yet visible above
In beauty glorified.
No angel in the sky
Can fully bear that sight,
But downward bends his burning eye 
At mysteries so bright.

4. Crown Him the Lord of years, 
The Potentate of time,
Creator of the rolling spheres,
Ineffably sublime!
All hail, Redeemer, hail! 
For Thou hast died for me;
Thy praise shall never, never fail
Throughout eternity.
 


301 PRAISE HIM!

1. PRAISE Him! praise Him! Jesus, our blessed Redeemer,
Sing, ye saints, His wonderful love proclaim;
Hail Him! hail Him! mightiest angels in glory,
Strength and honour give to His holy name. 
Like a shepherd, Jesus will feed His people,
In His arms He carries them all day long.
O ye saints, that dwell in the light of His presence,
Praise Him! praise Him! ever in joyful song.

2. Praise Him! praise Him! Jesus, our blessed Redeemer,
For our sins He suffered and bled and died;
He's our rock, our hope of eternal salvation;
Hail Him! hail Him! Jesus the Crucified.
Holy Saviour, meekly enduring sorrow,
Crowned with thorns that cruelly pierced His brow; 
Once for us rejected, despised and forsaken,
Prince of glory, He is triumphant now.

3. Praise Him! praise Him! Jesus our blessed Redeemer,
Heavenly portals loud with hosannas ring;
Jesus, Saviour, liveth for ever and ever;
Laud Him! laud Him! Prophet and Priest and King!
Death is vanquished; tell it with joy, ye faithful; 
Where is now thy victory, boasting grave?
Jesus lives! no longer thy portals are cheerless, 
Jesus lives, the mighty and strong to save.



302 CALCUTTA

1. MY Redeemer! oh what beauties 
In that lovely name appear! 
None but Jesus in His glories
Shall the honoured title wear. 
My Redeemer,
Thou hast my salvation wrought.

2. Sunk in ruin, sin and misery.
Bound by Satan's captive chain; 
Guided by his artful treachery,
Hurrying on to endless pain;
My Redeemer
Plucked me as a brand from hell.

3. Mine for time and mine for ever,
Mine by oath and mine by blood, 
Mine, nor time the bond shall sever,
Mine as the unchanging God.
My Redeemer!
Oh, how sweet to call Him mine!

4. When in heaven I see Thy glory,
When before Thy throne I bow, 
Perfectly I shall be like Thee,
Fully Thy redemption know.
My Redeemer
Then shall hear me shout His praise. 


303 MY REDEEMER

1. I WILL sing of my Redeemer
And His wondrous love to me; 
On the cruel cross He suffered,
From the curse to set me free.

Sing, oh sing of my Redeemer!
With His blood He purchased me; 
On the cross He sealed my pardon,
Paid the debt and made me free.

2. I will tell the wondrous story,
How my lost estate to save,
In His boundless love and mercy
He the ransom freely gave.

3. I will praise my great Redeemer, 
His triumphant power I'll tell; 
How the victory He giveth
Over sin and death and hell. 

4. I will sing of my Redeemer
And His heavenly love to me;
He from death to life hath brought me, 
Son of God with Him to be.
 


304 PALMS OF GLORY

1. SWEETER sounds than music knows 
Charm me in Immanuel's name; 
All her hopes my spirit owes
To His birth and cross and shame.

2. When He came, the heavenly host 
Glory gave to God on high;
Lord, my tongue should praise Thee most, 
Who should louder sing than I?

3. Did the Lord a man become, 
That He might the law fulfil, 
Bleed and suffer in my room, 
And canst thou, my tongue, be still?

4. No, I must my praises bring, 
Though they feeble are and weak; 
For should I refuse to sing,
Sure the very stones would speak.

5. O my Saviour, Shield, and Sun,
Rock and Tower, Shepherd, Friend, 
Every precious name in one,
Love I owe Thee without end.
 


Section 12. Christ and His Church

305 WOOLWICH

1. WHAT raised the wondrous thought, 
Or who did it suggest,
That we the Church, to glory brought,
Should with the Son be blest?

2. O God, the thought was Thine, 
Thine only could it be;
Fruit of the wisdom, love divine, 
Peculiar unto Thee.

3. For sure no other mind
For thoughts so bold, so free, 
Greatness or strength could ever find; 
Thine only could it be.

4. The motives too, Thine own, 
The plan, the counsel Thine—
Made for Thy Son, bone of His bone, 
In glory bright to shine.

5. O God, with great delight
Thy wondrous thought we see 
"Upon His throne in glory bright
The Bride of Christ shall be."

6. Sealed with the Holy Ghost,
We triumph in that love; 
Thy wondrous thought has made our boast
"Glory with Christ above."
 


306 SARON

1.   LORD JESUS, are we one with Thee?
Oh height, oh depth of love! 
Once slain for us upon the tree,
We're one with Thee above.

2. Such was Thy grace that for our sake
Thou didst from heaven come down, 
With us of blood and flesh partake,
In all our sorrows one.

3. Our sins, our guilt, in love divine 
Confessed and borne by Thee;
The gall, the curse, the wrath were Thine, 
To set Thy members free.

4. Ascended now in glory bright,
Lord, one with us Thou art;
Nor life nor death nor depth nor height
Thy saints from Thee can part.

5. Oh, teach us, Lord, to know and own 
This wondrous mystery—
That Thou with us art truly one,
And we are one with Thee.

6. Soon, soon shall come that glorious day, 
When, seated on Thy throne,
Thou shalt to wondering worlds display 
That Thou with us art one.
